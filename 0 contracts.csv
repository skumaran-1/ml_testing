"FDA Target State Architecture v1.0 September 2014 
","The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Directorate has a continuing requirement for nuclear safety cross check analysis, performance analysis and technical evaluation, independent verification and validation contract.

BACKGROUND
The Minuteman III (MMIII) is a mature weapon system that is in the Operations and Support Phase of its life cycle. As a critical leg in the strategic nuclear triad, the ICBM Weapon System requires continued sustainment of the critical software to ensure operational capabilities are maintained and new war-fighter requirements are implemented and independently certified for operational nuclear surety. The ICBM weapon system software requires updates and independent nuclear certification to provide a supportable and functional weapon system through 2075. The NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor independently assesses that nuclear critical software will only perform as intended: There has been no intentional/unintentional sabotage, and will not cause any unintended nuclear consequences.

Based on historical data, the anticipated workload is expected to be approximately 85% NSCCA/PATE and 15% IV&V.

REQUIREMENTS
Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis/Performance Analysis and Technical Evaluation/Independent Verification and Validation

Nuclear critical software evaluations are accomplished through NSCCA and IV&V code review, simulation testing, and deep analysis. Although these evaluations use many similar techniques, they typically have different requirements and, consequently, the analysis and reporting are different. Since NSCCA affects software that is nuclear critical, the contractor needs to consider that a significant majority of the effort under this PWS will be slanted toward NSCCA efforts and that IV&V efforts are subsidiary to NSCCA. IV&V efforts typically involve programs that support nuclear critical software. The analysis under IV&V ensures compliance with requirements levied on the software being studied. PATE efforts, currently not mandated by the Safety Center, are considered in parallel with other analysis. Both NSCCA and IV&V are performed by an organization that is technically, managerially, and financially independent of the developer. The AFSEC/SEW will make the final determination regarding independence requirements.

Nuclear safety design certified software is evaluated according to the Government Certification Requirements Plan (CRP). AFMAN 91-119, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems Software, provides criteria for NSCCA evaluation. Requirements for software evaluation can range from full NSCCA to IV&V/NSATE to qualification testing, depending on the relationship to critical functions such as authorization, pre-arming, launching, releasing, arming, and targeting. Requirements for software evaluation can change according to the current Air Force directives. ALL current Air Force nuclear certification requirements must be integrated and followed and are to be followed by the NSCCA contractor as soon as declared in force unless exempted by waiver.

NSCCA and IV&V evaluations will parallel the development lifecycle with incremental deliveries of requirements, design, and code changes from the program and developers as defined at task order level.

Nuclear Surety

The Air Force uses the DoD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program definition for Nuclear Weapons Surety: Policies, procedures, controls, and actions that encompass safety, security, and control measures which ensure there will be no nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, or degradation of weapon effectiveness during its lifecycle. The contractor shall comply with requirements listed in Appendix B: Applicable Compliance/Reference Documents.

The contractor shall support the Government in maintaining its ICBM Nuclear Certification Program IAW requirements detailed in DoD Directive (DoDD) 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapon Surety Program, DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program Manual, and AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.

Engineering Services

The contractor shall perform tasks in accordance with separately issued task orders providing engineering, technical, and support services, as specified therein.

Tools Sustainment

The contractor shall maintain and modify Government Furnished Property (GFP) (see Section 5: Property Management) that is provided in support of ICBM NSCCA/PATE IV&V task orders. The objectives of NSCCA/PATE/IV&V tools include accelerating analyses, reducing Government Test Lab needs by the NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor, and the ability to confirm anomalies that are difficult to or cannot be replicated in the Government labs.

Program Support

The contractor shall maintain technical, managerial, and financial independence from ICBM Program software developers IAW AFI 91-103. The Air Force Safety Center, Weapons Safety Division (AFSEC/SEW), will make the final determination regarding organizational independency requirements. The contractor shall include the ICBMSD in all communications between contractor and developer as required to maintain awareness of necessary developer interactions.",0
