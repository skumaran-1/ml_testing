"Attain, LLC is fulfilling the US Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) continuing requirement for logistics &amp; administrative support for IT activities, project management, software license &amp; maintenance management, cybersecurity planning, and enterprise architecture support. 

 BACKGROUND 

 The National Energy Technology Laboratory is a multi-purpose national laboratory, owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The NETL implements research and development (R&amp;D) programs to advance energy and energy-related environmental technology and focuses on finding tools and processes that simultaneously address the three overarching issues that characterize today&#39;s energy situation in the United States: energy affordability, supply security, and environmental quality. 

 NETL has three research laboratories that span the Nation. Laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Morgantown, W.Va., conduct a broad range of research and development (R&amp;D) to increase the supply of traditional energy resources, improve the efficiency and environmental performance of thermoelectric power generation, and help end-users to conserve energy. Researchers at the NETL laboratory in Albany, Ore., focus on developing advanced materials for use in the energy industry. NETL also has small offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Fairbanks, Alaska, that address challenges unique to those energy-rich regions. All five locations support DOE&#39;s mission to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the United States. 
 
As the only national laboratory owned and operated by DOE, NETL is unique in how it conducts business and in the relationships it forms with industry, academia, research organizations, and other national laboratories. The laboratory conducts cutting-edge R&amp;D on site. About one quarter of NETL&#39;s 1,200 Federal and contractor employees are engaged in research with industry, government, and academic partners to solve problems that would otherwise become barriers to commercializing advanced power systems, fuels, and environmental and waste-management technologies. NETL obtains basic and fundamental research through collaboration with universities and through its competitively selected site support contracts; this work supplements the applied research performed by NETL&#39;s Federal scientist and engineers. 
 
In addition NETL applies its extensive technology- and project management capabilities to shape, fund, and manage research conducted throughout the United States and in more than 40 foreign countries. The laboratory&#39;s research portfolio includes more than 1,300 projects, with a total award value of nearly $11 billion and private sector cost sharing of nearly $6 billion. To secure these projects, NETL uses a variety of contracting arrangements with corporations, small businesses, universities, non-profit organizations, and other national laboratories and government agencies. 
 
NETL also provides strategic information and analysis to the policymakers responsible for providing direction and funds to ensure that America has a continuing supply of clean, affordable energy. NETL provides (1) expert scientific and engineering analysis of technology options, developmental pathways, energy scenarios, and technical advancements; (2) programmatic and socio-economic impact analysis and benefits appraisals; (3) expert simulation and modeling using state-of-the-art systems; and (4) analysis of energy systems infrastructure inter dependencies, including policy implications. 
 
NETL funds nearly 500 R&amp;D projects at U.S. universities to advance energy science and technology and to provide a trained workforce for the energy industry of the future. NETL&#39;s outreach efforts also include a speakers&#39; bureau, visiting professor program, Adopt-a-School program, high school science bowls, in-school demonstrations, computer donations to area schools, job shadowing for high school students, and other initiatives that encourage careers in science and engineering. NETL expects the same level of educational support from its contractors and looks for organization that meet or exceed those expectations by forming partnerships and teaming with universities. 
 
NETL&#39;s organization structure comprises seven areas of interest: 
Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil 
Strategic Center for Coal 
Office of Systems, Analysis and Planning 
Project Management Center 
Office of Research and Development 
Office of Institutional and Business Operations

"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Justice Management Division has a continuing requirement for a wide range of Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) across the entire systems development life cycle. 

 BACKGROUND 

 This requirement is referred to as &quot;Information Technology Support Services&quot; or ITSS. Each successive generation of awarded contract has added a numerical value to identify its generation: 

 
	 
	 This requirement is referred to as ITSS-5 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 2011 are referred to as ITSS IV or ITSS-4 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 2004 were referred to as ITSS III or ITSS-3 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 1999 were referred to as ITSS II or ITSS-2 
	 
	 
	 The original contracts, awarded in 1996 were referred to as ITSS 
	 
 

 Most Department of Justice (DOJ) organizations have their own small staff of computer specialists, systems analysts, and programmers to provide information technology (IT) support services. Nevertheless, they do not maintain a sufficient staff of personnel to meet the anticipated demand for systems development and other IT support services. Nor do they maintain technical expertise in the multiplicity of equipment, operating systems, languages and applications currently in use, planned or potentially applicable within the Department. 
 
When DOJ organizations cannot fulfill their requirements using in-house staff, they often need contractor support quickly. Realizing this need, the Department decided to establish a set of contracts to provide software development and other IT-related services to Department components. 
 
Since its inception, the Department has required that the contractors under the ITSS program compete for the work at the task order level. Competition at the task order level has proven cost-effective, and has yielded significant savings. It has enabled the Government to obtain high-quality technical expertise at a reasonable cost. 
 
The ITSS contracts are available for use on a voluntary basis. 
 
Fee-for-Service. This IDIQ Multiple Award Contract vehicle may be utilized by any DOJ component (e.g. Office, Bureau, or Division) on a fee-for-service basis. The DOJ Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) will coordinate with the COTR to create the specific fee-for-service schedule for the program and establish Intra-agency Agreements as necessary to transfer and/or reimburse funds to DOJ to compete, award, and oversee the work plan requests and resulting task orders. The fee-for-service schedule established at the onset of this contract may change from time-to-time as determined by the Office of the CIO, but not more than once per fiscal year. The unit prices contained in this contract do not include any kind of industrial funding fee or similar charging factor. 
 
Non-DOJ Federal agencies have used the ITSS program to avoid the administrative costs of creating and managing their own Task Order services program. For non-DOJ agencies, the requesting agency is required to certify that it has met its own internal agency review requirements and that it has decided to use the DOJ contracts. 
 
The contracts may be used to fulfill a wide range of requirements in any of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) areas. While the variety and scope of services that will be required is known, the specific tasks to be ordered over the coming years, and their distribution across the SDLC, are not clear. The continuing emergence and rapid adoption of new technologies by Government agencies strongly suggest that the very nature of IT support services tasks will not necessarily resemble that of prior years. Large-scale systems integration acquisitions, new applications within DOJ component organizations, and the integration of and modifications to current systems will have significant impacts on future development efforts in DOJ agencies. 
 
The Department anticipates that the ITSS contracts will be used to provide IT services that: 

 
	 Go beyond sustaining and expanding use of current hardware, operating systems and software 
	 Increase business effectiveness and automation through the effective use and adoption of systems by leveraging new technologies and applications, best practices, and software 
	 Create new applications and introduce new technologies as they emerge 
	 Give expert assistance in configuring and managing computer hardware, software and networks, in training users, and in improving systems and network security 
	 Facilitate business change and flexibility by architecting, designing, and developing solutions that enable the rapid realization of new or changed requirements 
	 Protect the business by ensuring that systems, applications, and practices are secure 
	 Measure and continually improve customer service and satisfaction
