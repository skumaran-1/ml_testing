 BACKGROUND 

 The National Energy Technology Laboratory is a multi-purpose national laboratory, owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The NETL implements research and development (R&amp;D) programs to advance energy and energy-related environmental technology and focuses on finding tools and processes that simultaneously address the three overarching issues that characterize today&#39;s energy situation in the United States: energy affordability, supply security, and environmental quality. 

 NETL has three research laboratories that span the Nation. Laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pa., and Morgantown, W.Va., conduct a broad range of research and development (R&amp;D) to increase the supply of traditional energy resources, improve the efficiency and environmental performance of thermoelectric power generation, and help end-users to conserve energy. Researchers at the NETL laboratory in Albany, Ore., focus on developing advanced materials for use in the energy industry. NETL also has small offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Fairbanks, Alaska, that address challenges unique to those energy-rich regions. All five locations support DOE&#39;s mission to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the United States. 
 
As the only national laboratory owned and operated by DOE, NETL is unique in how it conducts business and in the relationships it forms with industry, academia, research organizations, and other national laboratories. The laboratory conducts cutting-edge R&amp;D on site. About one quarter of NETL&#39;s 1,200 Federal and contractor employees are engaged in research with industry, government, and academic partners to solve problems that would otherwise become barriers to commercializing advanced power systems, fuels, and environmental and waste-management technologies. NETL obtains basic and fundamental research through collaboration with universities and through its competitively selected site support contracts; this work supplements the applied research performed by NETL&#39;s Federal scientist and engineers. 
 
In addition NETL applies its extensive technology- and project management capabilities to shape, fund, and manage research conducted throughout the United States and in more than 40 foreign countries. The laboratory&#39;s research portfolio includes more than 1,300 projects, with a total award value of nearly $11 billion and private sector cost sharing of nearly $6 billion. To secure these projects, NETL uses a variety of contracting arrangements with corporations, small businesses, universities, non-profit organizations, and other national laboratories and government agencies. 
 
NETL also provides strategic information and analysis to the policymakers responsible for providing direction and funds to ensure that America has a continuing supply of clean, affordable energy. NETL provides (1) expert scientific and engineering analysis of technology options, developmental pathways, energy scenarios, and technical advancements; (2) programmatic and socio-economic impact analysis and benefits appraisals; (3) expert simulation and modeling using state-of-the-art systems; and (4) analysis of energy systems infrastructure inter dependencies, including policy implications. 
 
NETL funds nearly 500 R&amp;D projects at U.S. universities to advance energy science and technology and to provide a trained workforce for the energy industry of the future. NETL&#39;s outreach efforts also include a speakers&#39; bureau, visiting professor program, Adopt-a-School program, high school science bowls, in-school demonstrations, computer donations to area schools, job shadowing for high school students, and other initiatives that encourage careers in science and engineering. NETL expects the same level of educational support from its contractors and looks for organization that meet or exceed those expectations by forming partnerships and teaming with universities. 
 
NETL&#39;s organization structure comprises seven areas of interest: 
Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil 
Strategic Center for Coal 
Office of Systems, Analysis and Planning 
Project Management Center 
Office of Research and Development 
Office of Institutional and Business Operations 
The Office of Crosscutting Functions

 BACKGROUND 

 This requirement is referred to as &quot;Information Technology Support Services&quot; or ITSS. Each successive generation of awarded contract has added a numerical value to identify its generation: 

 
	 
	 This requirement is referred to as ITSS-5 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 2011 are referred to as ITSS IV or ITSS-4 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 2004 were referred to as ITSS III or ITSS-3 
	 
	 
	 The contracts awarded in 1999 were referred to as ITSS II or ITSS-2 
	 
	 
	 The original contracts, awarded in 1996 were referred to as ITSS 
	 
 

 Most Department of Justice (DOJ) organizations have their own small staff of computer specialists, systems analysts, and programmers to provide information technology (IT) support services. Nevertheless, they do not maintain a sufficient staff of personnel to meet the anticipated demand for systems development and other IT support services. Nor do they maintain technical expertise in the multiplicity of equipment, operating systems, languages and applications currently in use, planned or potentially applicable within the Department. 
 
When DOJ organizations cannot fulfill their requirements using in-house staff, they often need contractor support quickly. Realizing this need, the Department decided to establish a set of contracts to provide software development and other IT-related services to Department components. 
 
Since its inception, the Department has required that the contractors under the ITSS program compete for the work at the task order level. Competition at the task order level has proven cost-effective, and has yielded significant savings. It has enabled the Government to obtain high-quality technical expertise at a reasonable cost. 
 
The ITSS contracts are available for use on a voluntary basis. 
 
Fee-for-Service. This IDIQ Multiple Award Contract vehicle may be utilized by any DOJ component (e.g. Office, Bureau, or Division) on a fee-for-service basis. The DOJ Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) will coordinate with the COTR to create the specific fee-for-service schedule for the program and establish Intra-agency Agreements as necessary to transfer and/or reimburse funds to DOJ to compete, award, and oversee the work plan requests and resulting task orders. The fee-for-service schedule established at the onset of this contract may change from time-to-time as determined by the Office of the CIO, but not more than once per fiscal year. The unit prices contained in this contract do not include any kind of industrial funding fee or similar charging factor. 
 
Non-DOJ Federal agencies have used the ITSS program to avoid the administrative costs of creating and managing their own Task Order services program. For non-DOJ agencies, the requesting agency is required to certify that it has met its own internal agency review requirements and that it has decided to use the DOJ contracts. 
 
The contracts may be used to fulfill a wide range of requirements in any of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) areas. While the variety and scope of services that will be required is known, the specific tasks to be ordered over the coming years, and their distribution across the SDLC, are not clear. The continuing emergence and rapid adoption of new technologies by Government agencies strongly suggest that the very nature of IT support services tasks will not necessarily resemble that of prior years. Large-scale systems integration acquisitions, new applications within DOJ component organizations, and the integration of and modifications to current systems will have significant impacts on future development efforts in DOJ agencies. 
 
The Department anticipates that the ITSS contracts will be used to provide IT services that: 

 
	 Go beyond sustaining and expanding use of current hardware, operating systems and software 
	 Increase business effectiveness and automation through the effective use and adoption of systems by leveraging new technologies and applications, best practices, and software 
	 Create new applications and introduce new technologies as they emerge 
	 Give expert assistance in configuring and managing computer hardware, software and networks, in training users, and in improving systems and network security 
	 Facilitate business change and flexibility by architecting, designing, and developing solutions that enable the rapid realization of new or changed requirements 
	 Protect the business by ensuring that systems, applications, and practices are secure 
	 Measure and continually improve customer service and satisfaction

 BACKGROUND: 

 HR encompasses the full life cycle of personnel categories, services, and support to Defense personnel and their communities, civilians, military components, families, veterans, retirees, and communities worldwide. HR Solutions Program Office was launched in 2004 and is now one of the Business Transformation initiatives housed in Headquarters, Department of the Army. Today, HR Solutions is a living component of the Army&#39;s continuing efforts to transform itself in order to offer best business practices for HR services (through contracts) and ultimately to ensure quality and predictability of cost and effective services, where and when needed. It is designed totally as a performance based program and organized to streamline the acquisition of human resource (HR) services, through competitive, efficient, standardized and well managed process, that emphasizes accountability and performance. This full life-cycle contract support is provided in a competitively managed multiple-contractor environment. The program office has initiated contracts with multiple vendors that cover all HR-related functional areas and disciplines that support those functions. The range of services implementation, operational and planning levels covers a broad array of requirements from individual services world wide to agency-wide organizational and program operations, including the provision of centralized management is to provide standardized programs to individuals and decentralized organizations throughout the world. The vision of HR Solutions to enhance its capabilities to assume greater responsibility to senior leaders in supporting HR mission and functions related requirements triggered by current events, congressional mandates, or resourcing constraints due to Brac Realignments and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 10. 

 The Army Contracting Agency (ACA) is a Field Operating Agency reporting to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. The ACA became an operational Agency on 1 October 2002. The reason behind the creation of the ACA was to ensure that the Army contracting is reshaped to: 

 
	 Consolidate similar and common use contracts to reduce redundancy and leverage economies of scale 
	 Complete the implementation of centers and satellites contract requirements consolidation and 
	 Reduce management overhead and realign personnel to maximize efficient and effective operations 
 

 In order to accomplish this mission, two regional service-contracting centers and one Electronic Commerce/Commercial Contracting Center (E-commerce Center) for non-tactical/strategic information technology (IT) and commercial items was established. The regional contracting centers divided the CONUS contracting structure along Geographical line to align with and complement the Centralized Installation Management (CIM) realignment plan.

 BACKGROUND: 

 The contractor shall provide technical and scientific support to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#39;s (NOAA) Office of Response and Restoration (ORR). The contractor shall provide support through an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract. Task orders will be issued against the contract on an as-needed basis for the required work. 
 
Contractor support may be required to respond to tasks on both an emergency and non-emergency time frame. It is anticipated that a higher percentage of effort will be for non-time critical support, but the ability of the contractor to respond quickly during an emergency event is critical to ORR&#39;s mission and paramount to the fulfillment of the contractor&#39;s obligations. The focus of the technical and scientific support is chemistry-related issues during hazardous material and petroleum spills, but ORR may support all hazards missions, such as disaster responses and port security contingency planning issues that involve chemical risks. 

 REQUIREMENTS: 

 The Tasks associated with this opportunity include: 

 
	 Incident Response &amp; Incident Response Preparation:
	 
		 Respond to calls from ORR within one-hour of the initial contact and be able to provide support directly by verbal consultation or have access to the resources required to investigate the request and provide follow-up communications both verbally and in writing 
		 Provide oral and written reports as required, reflecting information or specific support requested 
		 A common request will be a concise assessment of the hazards associated with the spilled chemical, the transport and fate of the chemical relative to the specific incident environment, and any unique or scenario-specific concerns 
		 Such reports are generally defined as Chemical Hazard Assessments rather than risk assessment since they identify threats rather than probability 
		 Other emergency requests might include recommendations for sampling or a review of proposed sampling and/or analytical protocols, or to recommend or review mitigation techniques 
		 Perform On-Scene Response Support, requiring travel to the site of the incident to provide direct consultation and technical/scientific support to federal response personnel and cleanup personnel on issues related to chemistry 
	 
	 
	 Workshops and Training:
	 
		 Develop training materials and conduct training and workshops as requested. Training may be requested as part of planned activities across the U.S. and its territories or at the contractor&#39;s base of operations. On rare occasions, a workshop or training activity will require travel outside of the U.S. 
	 
	 
	 Research and Development:
	 
		 Provide technical support in the area of chemistry as required to support ORR in its mission critical activities. 
		 This may require the contractor to develop, manage, and perform research projects, as well as contribute to the projects managed by ORR personnel 
	 
	 
	 Analytical and Laboratory Support:
	 
		 Provide analytical support for the analysis of environmental samples contaminated with petroleum and/or petroleum products to determine the relevant physical characteristics, short-term fate, and apparent toxicity of the oil based on the relative distribution of PAH

 BACKGROUND: 

 The federal government is committed to changing its business processes to achieve a world class standard of excellence. This is being accomplished by adopting best business practices and the latest technology to create a more efficient, citizen-centered federal government. 
 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been designated as an executive agent for purposes of providing Information Technology (IT) to the government. Under this authority, NIH established three Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) to support the full range of IT needs across the federal government, with a particular emphasis on agencies like NIH and its parent, HHS, that are involved in health care and clinical and biological research. 
 
The NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) took its first major step in developing a successor GWAC to its current Chief Information Officer - Solutions and Partners 2 Innovations (CIO-SP2i) and the Image World 2 New Dimensions (IW2nd) GWACs, which both expired in December 2010, by posting a Request for Information (RFI) in FedBizOps on April 30, 2008. The successor contract will continue to support government IT efforts with a focus on health and biomedical-related IT services in support of federal agencies&#39; health missions.
