AEC NMIC1 REFURBISH CAFETERIA DINING AREA NATIONAL MARITIME INTELLIGENCE CENTER SUITLAND MD,"SMRC understands that NWS requires contractor support to assist in providing specialized CHPS support 
help desk functions performed by the HSG, which provides Tier 1 and Tier 2 specialized help desk 
support for the CHPS operations at RFCs. Our staff will work “shoulder to shoulder” with federal HSG 
staff, and specific day to day guidance on contractor tasking will be provided to contractor personnel by 
the HSG staff. 
HSG CHPS development and sustainment, aided by the contractor, comprises part of a major NWS 
operating plan goal: “Provide 24 x 7 support to address operational issues related to AWIPS and CHPS 
hydrologic software at 13 RFCs and 122 WFOs.” The objective is the stable and functional operation of 
the NWS RFC river forecasting enabled by CHPS. 
HSG support includes that for the operational software suite 
named NWS River Forecast System (NWSRFS) which has 
been the NWS hydrologic forecasting mainstay for over four 
decades. Developed in the 1970’s and 1980’s, the system 
was developed and implemented in an era of limited 
computational and storage capabilities and with 
development concepts prevalent in that time and now 
obsolete. Consequently, NWSRFS is monolithic, with code 
that is intertwined and difficult to separate into functional 
components. More importantly, because of limitations imposed by computer systems at the time of its 
early development, NWSRFS has confounded efforts to support the modern physically based and 
computationally intensive forecast models. Constrained by the available computational technology, its 
fundamental architecture and lack of modularity is a serious barrier to deploying modern advanced 
forecast models and the exploitation of more recent advances in interactive forecasting and modeling. 
For over two decades, NWS managers and developers have recognized the limitations imposed by the 
NWSRFS architecture which made it difficult both to maintain the code base and to incorporate modern 
models as well as modern computing concepts. While the hydrology community was making major 
advances in the science and computational concepts, NWS was unable to leverage these advances to 
improve its own capabilities so that they could be incorporated into a modern NWS forecast operation. 
Significantly, the open architecture and functional software separability that characterizes CHPS allows 
for NWS developers, academic researchers and industry partners easily to connect to the CHPS to test 
new concepts in hydrologic science, graphical display and data products. CHPS has as its underlying 
architecture a software suite called Flood Early Warning System (FEWS or “Delft FEWS”), developed by 
the Deltares Institute for Applied Research based in Delft in the Netherlands. FEWS incorporates an 
open system modular concept that allows easy integration of new forecast models and tools into a 
framework that includes other models and functional components such as real-time database access to 
dynamic and static datasets, data reformatting and graphical displays of both unidimensional (e.g., time 
series) and multidimensional data (e.g., map projections). As such, it provides the fundamental 
functionality to build a complete interactive forecast environment. Understanding of Desired Outcomes – SMRC will provide Tier 2 
specialized help desk support to provide resolution of day-to-day 
technical issues for NWS both for its facilities in Silver Spring and 
its 13 River Forecast Centers (RFC) personnel, during normal 
hours of operation. We will ensure that NWS’ systems and 
applications supporting RFC forecasting are available and 
operational whenever and wherever needed. Our staff will provide 
rapid and effective problem resolution in response to service 
requests. Our staff is prepared to provide NWS operations and 
development personnel, as well as outside collaborators, with 
responsive customer support by knowledgeable, experienced 
personnel using procedures that have proven effective on numerous contracts. 
Approach to Achieving the Desired Outcomes – SMRC has implemented successful, centralized help desk 
models across multiple contracts with numerous federal government clients. Our approach implements 
accountability for individual staff and for the corporation as a whole by establishing a set of Service Level 
Agreements (SLA) at the outset of the task order (TO). The SLAs are a set of customer service 
expectations and associated metrics that allow NWS and SMRC to measure quality of performance. 
Importantly, when examined over a time period, the metrics history may point to a trend in performance 
(positive or negative) and may signal a need for management intervention that may include, for example, 
the additional training. For example, an SLA may be “Rapid return to service of a reported software 
failure.” The metric for the purposes of this illustrative example may be “Return to service within three 
hours of reporting failure.” We will develop and negotiate these SLAs and metrics with NWS as a first 
step in initiating our service following task award. The SLA definitions and associated metrics will be 
made in consultation with the NWS Task Manager to be consistent with priorities for the contracted 
service. 
For efficiency and appropriate personnel resource allocation, help desk support for an organization as 
large and complex as NWS is normally organized into a multi-tiered hierarchy. The specific support to be 
applied in any particular instance depends on the severity of the problem, its effect on forecast operations 
and the skill level required to address it.The NWS field support help desk is organized and operated as a multi-tiered customer service facility 
accepting, resolving, and dispatching technical staff to address requests for technical assistance, changes, 
and/or system software and hardware installations. Typically such an operation consists of three tiers of 
support services each of which is associated with a particular set of priorities, problem severity and staff 
skills. 
 Tier 1 technicians provide over-the-phone (through the use of a dedicated cell phone because the 
technician may be roaming) assistance and resolutions and roaming desk-side assistance. The Tier 1 
technician normally addresses simple user requests and problems that can routinely be resolved in 
less than a day (and often in several minutes) and will not require additional support from other staff 
members. 
 Tier 2 personnel serve as the initial level of escalation when the problem is more complex, requires 
mid-to-senior levels of technical knowledge, and/or affects multiple users. Tier 1 staff, will dispatch 
Tier 2 staff, as necessary, and problems will be resolved within an agreed upon timeframe. 
 Tier 3 normally refers to corporate subject matter experts (SME) or OEM vendor consultants who 
possess an advanced technical understanding of the hardware and software. Tier 3 experts are 
dispatched as necessary by Tier 1 or Tier 2 staff and only under the most difficult or unusual of 
circumstances and particularly in an emergency situation. 
Our customer relationship processes capture and track all “issues” through our requirements management 
system (i.e., help desk software) by creating a “service ticket” for each event. Service tickets are issued by 
Tier 1 help desk personnel who normally represent a first line of contact by the supported user 
community. The service ticket is initiated as a result of a phone call, an e-mail contact, a Web-based 
request or a walk-up in-person conversation. Each ticket is categorized and prioritized to match it to a 
corresponding SLA to establish its expected resolution time. It is SMRC’s approach to the SLA 
management process that facilitates the overall notification and escalation processes in tracking and resolving service tickets. Exhibit 2 outlines the SMRC service ticket tracking and problem resolution 
methodology and the process of problem escalation leading to efficient resolution. 
SMRC will support NWS through the existing NWS service ticket system and a multi-tiered help desk 
system. Service calls will be received via multiple media, ranging from a central phone number, Web 
input, e-mail, or even a hallway encounter, and then issued to our on-duty CHPS Hydrometeorologist. 
When a request for technical assistance is received, it is entered into the NWS help desk system by our 
CHPS Hydrometeorologist. The CHPS Hydrometeorologist’s prime responsibility is to keep the customer 
informed as to the status of his/her request and to ensure that service tickets are closed within the SLA 
time. Our specialist closes a service ticket after reporting the problem resolution to the customer and 
receiving the customer’s acceptance. The processes and procedures for Tier 1 support describe the 
required actions resolve a problem and close a service ticket. 
The accumulated service tickets with their problem 
resolution description will be maintained in a knowledge 
database for future reference by help desk personnel. That 
knowledge base will be a valuable tool for future reference, 
assisting the help desk personnel to track frequently 
recurring problems or user requests and by providing a 
store of information to assist personnel in tackling the same 
or similar issue in the future. Additionally, we will maintain 
a database of frequently asked questions (FAQ), that are 
helpful particularly to Tier 1 personnel, so as to avoid 
service potential ticket escalation if the issue in question has 
occurred before and has occurred frequently. 
Our approach to help desk support includes documentation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) 
associated with customer support (i.e., system administration, network administration, desktop 
administration, etc.). These SOPs will provide detailed operational procedures for all required services 
and system maintenance. We always establish SOPs for call handling, call tracking, call escalation, and 
call status review. Typically, these procedures cover methods to initiate a call, provide an overview of 
how calls are resolved, and describe priorities and response times in terms of a variety of problems. We 
will maintain the SOPs as “living documents,” incorporating NWS-approved changes throughout the life 
of the TO. Additionally, the SOPs will outline NWS-established reporting requirements and SLAs. 
Emergency Support – SMRC understands the importance of immediately responding to emergency 
service requests and situations. Emergencies are defined as a system event that seriously impedes forecast 
operations, a security breach, a loss of capability caused by fire or water damage, or a loss of capability or 
functionality associated with the installation of a software/hardware upgrade or new version that degrades 
the users’ ability to continue to work. For emergency service requests, we will immediately respond to the 
call and initiate procedures for emergency service. Such procedures include assigning the service ticket as 
an emergency call in the call management system; notifying the NWS TM and immediately taking steps 
to track, diagnose, and effect the problem resolution; and immediately invoking the necessary resources to 
provide resolution (such as subject-matter experts from corporate team resources or technical support 
from the OEM vendor). Emergency service calls will take precedence above all other types of service 
requests until resolved. Our CHPS personnel will continually update the NWS TM (and COTR as 
necessary) until the emergency is resolved. 
SMRC, in consultation with other help desk service providers at NWS, will also recommend, propose, 
implement, and integrate other tools as needed to collaborate with systems currently in use at NWS RFCs. 
This integration of network management, change management, configuration management, asset 
management, and systems management tools will facilitate cross-functional analysis of services and 
performance. It will also allow us to record, view, and track service problems in real time and help Quality Assurance – SMRC has had extensive experience in developing and adhering to quality assurance 
procedures for help desk support on several government contracts. For this TO, we will monitor the 
performance of the staff in handling service tickets and collecting, evaluating, and reporting performance 
statistics. To ensure that all tickets were closed properly, our staff will contact users when a service ticket is 
ready to be closed requesting validation of problem resolution. Quality control of help desk services is 
possibly more critical than any other contract activity, because it is customer centric. Resolving customer 
requests with a tool-enabled, knowledgeable, and trained staff is key to SMRC’s overall Quality Plan. In 
providing support for our customers, SMRC includes help desk services in our continual process 
improvement cycle. Quality measurements are made reflecting the primary functions of the help desk. These 
include speed of call answer, courtesy of call handler, quality of problem resolution, quality of the data 
capture, timeliness of problem resolution, and overall customer satisfaction. Our approach will ensure that 
customer support requests are processed, analyzed, and resolved in a professional and timely manner and 
that RSIS meets or exceeds the required outcomes proscribed in the PWS. 
Help desk commercial packages (e.g., Remedy or Heat) normally provide several means to establish and 
monitor time-based SLAs for help desk management. Metrics and thresholds can be set using the 
provided functionality. For example, use of Remedy’s Business Process Automation Module (BPAM) 
provides warnings prior to service-level failure. Alerts can be set up according to requirements stated in 
SLAs, urgent calls can be displayed, and tracking and reporting can be performed by the Remedy, 
allowing for performance tracking against requirements. Effective structuring of the help desk tool and 
modules will provide for quick response and issue turnaround for improvement. We will also investigate 
other tool implementations to ensure that tools are being used to their maximum performance. We will 
use and improve support tool reporting capabilities to ensure accurate usage reporting. These activities 
will help identify areas for improvement in meeting NWS’ PWS metrics thresholds. 
2.2.2 Technical Support for NWS Projects 
Associated with CHPS 
Technical Support for Special Projects – While help 
desk support will take precedence over other activities, 
SMRC’s Hydrometeorologists will support ongoing and 
future special projects associated with enhancing and 
upgrading CHPS to further improve RFC forecast 
operations and efficiency. This work may be efforts 
comprising several days or up to several months. We will 
work with other NWS developers and contractors in 
designing, developing and implementing new 
functionality. We will perform both desktop analyses as 
well as rapid prototyping of new concepts. Our experts 
will be full partners with NWS in evaluating new 
software developed by the participating CHPS community, particularly special functionality developed by 
participants at RFCs. To this end we will promote the original intent of NWS’ launch of CHPS as a 
community effort. 
2.2.3 Providing Technical Guidance

Team RIVA would look to cap bandwidth based on 12 month estimate to avoid unnecessary expenditure.
Across any two locations within public cloud In this scenario, there are two general cost scenarios. Data transfer costs depend on whether data is being exchanged with-in an availability zone or across availability zones. Intra region (within an availability zone) data transfer costs are free and should not be charged any bandwidth surcharge. Inter-region data transfer does incur a per GB/Gbps cost and must be modeled. Inbound Data transfer costs in Azure and AWS are free.
From public cloud locations to general public endpoints
From public cloud locations to other cloud (public, private, or hybrid clouds) locations CSP per GB Data transfer costs must be modeled for any data transfer that originates from the public cloud to an endpoint that is a public, private or hybrid cloud
Data traversing a Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) stack Currently the TIC Overlay architecture is in Pilot mode for CSPs and has not been fully FedRAMP approved. Thus any use case requiring TIC data traverse should be reviewed by JAB/FedRAMP for applicability
From NOAA/NESDIS premises to the public cloud locations From public cloud locations to NOAA/NESDIS premise Inbound Data transfer costs in Azure and AWS are free, However, Team RIVA will need to model the effective cost on outbound transfer from the NOAA/NESDIS premises as that consumes ISP bandwidth even if it is a fixed cost. In this scenario, appropriate throttling needs to be put in place for high bandwidth applications.
Team RIVA is currently supporting AWS RDS and DynamoDB services for NESDIS Team RIVA will ensure that for the NESDIS Cloud BPA, FedRAMP compliant cloud-native Managed Database Services will be incorporated into sandbox templates for deployment. As part of the responsibility, Team RIVA will provide full DBMS administrative control to the administrator account. Team RIVA will support ""Managed Database Services"" which include standard database management tasks such as DBMS provisioning (including templated environments) as well as providing alternatives for DBMS security, operations, scaling, backups, patch management, and replication. Team RIVA has experience managing these functions via the CSP management console or CLI for advanced automation tasks.Team RIVA understands that no organization has an unlimited budget; therefore, it is necessary to monitor utilization and costs across internal and cloud based assets. Team RIVA will provide NOAA with CloudCheckr for tracking all billing. CloudCheckr offers a variety of cost based billing reports. The cost reports not only show NOAA how much it is paying for its AWS architecture, but also highlights areas where costs could be better optimized. Billing reports will show NOAA’s current AWS invoice, how much NOAA has spent on each service, and provide a billing history. The metrics provided by CloudCheckr are on a web accessible portal that contains historical data within a 365-day timespan, cost summaries, and details categorized across NOAA groups through the use of tagging. CloudCheckr’s data is made available every hour. CloudCheckr gives NOAA a consolidated, single pane of glass to better organize, manage, and optimize its cloud environment. Aggressive monitoring and fiscal control of distributed cloud resources will enable NESDIS to ensure that the organization is maximizing scientific experimentation within the bounds of the fiscal limitations. For the NESDIS Cloud environment, there will be a large focus on cost optimization related to the many algorithmic processing sandboxes that need to be managed in the AWS cloud environment to ensure performance and cost targets are met.
In addition, Team RIVA BPA Program Manager is constantly monitoring what CSP services are FedRAMP approved, under JAB Review or under 3PAO Assessment. For example, a partial listing of the AWS CSP matrix is listed in Figure 5. Team RIVA also tracks the appropriate matrices for other CSPs such as Microsoft Azure which is available in the Azure ServiceTrust Portal. Team RIVA understands the importance of ensuring the security requirements of any future service are appropriately considered before moving into the concept stage.
Team RIVA adopts cloud best practices for cloud migration to ensure a seamless process for managing or migrating critical workload. Team RIVA is currently executing similar migration work for NESDIS and will ensure that the following elements are addressed:
• Team RIVA will function as a migration services partner with NESDIS to successfully migrate applications to and from the cloud using CSP best practices
• Team RIVA will function as an application management services partner with NOAA to administer, maintain, and support applications in the cloud in accordance with FedRAMP and NOAA security guidelines.
The typical process is outline in Figure 6 below:




Figure 6:  Stages of TEAM RIVA’s Cloud Migration Process

In the cloud migration process to create new sandbox environments in a CSP it is paramount that the security posture of the environment is maintained before, during and after the migration. Therefore, the following best practices must be followed as part of the process to harden security:
• Safeguarding CSP credentials in accordance with FISMA/FedRAMP guidance
• Restrict users to AWS resources
• Automate security policies
• Adopting and testing a recovery strategy
In addition to effectively manage a cloud environment, new services need to be evaluated to ensure alignment and efficiency with the latest cloud technology. As the NESDIS Cloud Sandbox environment evolves, Team RIVA can match the evolution to new cloud services that may allow for cost or processing efficiencies.
The four stages of cloud transformation are described in Figure 7 and the Cloud Transformation Maturity Model. The steps include the Project Phase where the scope and design of the project are determined, then the Foundation Stage where the cloud environment requirements and services required are assessed. This phase can also include the necessary development processes that enable migration or making environments cloud ready. Then the project can enter the Migration phase where first dry runs can be executed to ensure the integrity of the data stays intact during migration and ultimately to a production
A.3 Overview of Technical Services applied to Specified Requirements
A.3.1 Virtual Machines (VM) (SOW 5.1)
Team RIVA will support cloud based virtual machines with the capabilities outlined in the BPA incuding RAM, vCPU, CPU bursting, VM Cloning/Templating , Geographic Location and ability to export OVFs (for migration, backup etc). In addition, Team RIVA will support Windows Server, RHEL and Open Source Linux. In addition , Team RIVA maintains an operational CSP checklist when deploying VMs to ensure adherence to security policy and best practices. These items include but are not limited to the following:
• Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide user-specific, rather than shared credentials for making AWS infrastructure requests.
• Ensure instances have Elastic Block Store versus instance store-backed which is not appropriate for enterprise grade storage
• Configure the appropriate Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) static address assignments, elastic IP addresses, or dynamic DNS).
• Leverage separate EBS volumes for the operating system and application/database data where appropriate.
• Configure back up for Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using Amazon EBS snapshots or another 3rd-party backup tool
• Test our process of recovering our EC2 instances or EBS volumes when they fail, either through”golden” Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Amazon EBS snapshots, bootstrapping, or using backup and recovery tools.
A.3.2 Cloud Sandbox Services (SOW 5.2)
Team RIVA will provide public cloud based sandbox services with the following capabilities:
• Capability of scaling sandboxes to meet project size/capability requirements
• Modular pricing model based on utilization of services within the sandbox

• Ability to create and store blueprints/templates within the sandboxes
Team RIVA will ensure that the cloud environment is deployed in AWS using a proven architecture with highly available data tier, and web tier in the architecture. Team RIVA uses AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), Auto Scaling where necessary and Elastic Load Balancing at the infrastructure layer to provide application layer high availability. Each region in AWS is a separate geographic area.
Each region is comprised of multiple AZs, isolated physical and logical locations with low-latency connectivity. Team RIVA’s design utilizes best practices by featuring application layer redundancy, with layers independently elastic, with no single points of failure (SPOF) providing for highly available infrastructure for the NESDIS Cloud environment. Furthermore, each service component (web delivery, application services, and database) has services that are designed to be self-healing through proactive monitoring and automated failover if any individual components or entire virtual servers fail.
In terms of maintaining uptime, Team RIVA understands the criticality of the NESDIS Cloud environment and Team RIVA has the ability to both monitor it using AWS CloudWatch monitoring


services as well as traditional host based SNMP based monitoring using tools such as Nagios to monitor specific application ports and protocols if further monitoring is required. Team RIVA also leverages synthetic external monitoring to mimic end user access of the system to alert on any slow page load or system error if any externally facing sites are required. In addition, Team RIVA leverages automated snapshots of virtual machines to ensure that environments can be restored quickly within restoration targets in case of data or virtual machine (vm) corruption. Storage Services (SOW 5.3) Team RIVA will provide public cloud based storage services, including persistent and archival storage. Team RIVA will support creating EBS volumes and maintain snapshots for restoration. In addtion, we will ensure that we can provide up to 1PB in Network Attached storage or S3 Object storage and will architect the storage requirements based on performance requirements. Team RIVA will assign and configure Geographic storage affinity and configure RBAC based access as required.
A.3.3 Network Device Management and Configuration (SOW 5.4)

A.3.5 Management Capabilities and Tools (SOW 5.6)
Team RIVA provide the following public cloud based management capabilities and tools ensuring that Deployments and configurations shall be managed through an automation tool. Team RIVA currently uses a combination of Chef/Puppet Ansible in the existing NESDIS environment we are managing.
RIVA will also monitor VM, Network, and Storage Services and manage associated alerts/reporting using Cloudwatch or similar tools. Team RIVA will monitor key system metrics on a monthly basis including CPU, memory, swap space, io wait time, application response time and availability. Based on these metrics Team RIVA will propose system changes to enhance efficiency. Team RIVA will ensure that AWS workloads are following AWS best practices for component reuse. For reusability, Team RIVA will ensure that the deployment process includes as much automation as feasible to reduce cycle times and will leverage approached like using a “gold image” baseline for operating systems.
A.4 Data Management Procedures
Team RIVA will advise the NESDIS Project Team with regards to best practices for the architecture of the NESDIS Cloud system and how enhancements to the system and upgrades to the infrastructure will fit into the overall architecture. We will support the development of a reference architecture and coding standards that ensure Team RIVA and NESDIS IT staff have a shared understanding of the NESDIS Cloud Sandbox environment and applications. We will assist with the development and implementation of policies and procedures for change management, configuration management and software development standards and will provide software tools that support consistent understanding and use of these procedures. All cloud tasks will be in accordance with NOAA security policy.
A.5 Understanding of Concept
Team RIVA will manage the environment based on the requirements and approach outlined in Section

A.6.4 Provide a Plan for Meeting the Government’s Security Requirements
Once NOAA adopts a specific environment (either AWS or Azure), we will assist NESDIS to receive or maintain the authority to operate. Team RIVA will develop the following documents using the NOAA OIT recommended templates of security artifacts. The following deliverables will be submitted at least annually or upon significant change to the system, and the details contained in the documents will reflect the actual environment as built:
• Security Categorization Form (SCF) to be completed with support from the Business Owner/ISSO
• Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Form, which is signed off by the NOAA Director of Privacy
• E-Authentication Form
• System Security Plan (SSP)
• Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP), to include the relevant parts specific to the system being developed/maintained.
• ISCP Annual Exercise/Test
Team RIVA will work with the Security Risk and Compliance teams to make sure the environment exceeds the necessary requirement and FISMA moderate standards. As the environment expands and scales, Team RIVA will ensure that the same secure configuration baseline that is derived from a “gold” image that is a known good. For IT System level, we engage the security accreditation team early and often to build security in at the beginning of every effort (when system waivers are not applicable). We recognize the lead times necessary for ATO and we make sure that no external team will ever wait on us to deliver artifacts. During system categorization, we build the necessary documentation to fully define Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) levels of High, Moderate, or Low, and then work with


the external teams to define controls across the system. During system development we continuously assess, test, and scan those controls to ensure compliance at the appropriate categorization.

USACE AEC APG BUILDING 5103 RENOVATIONS ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND MARYLAND,"SMRC is poised to continue providing superior
support with staff that are highly experienced in
physical sciences, system engineering, product
development, and implementation. The SMRC
System Enginner V will be prepared to support
ongoing scientific requirements as well as any
expansion and maintenance of NOAA
environmental satellite systems, and any new
development.
SMRC combines advanced technological expertise
with a comprehensive understanding of NOAA’s
missions and objectives to deliver expert oversight
that is process-driven to ensure successful operations for the Agency. Our System Administrators and
System Engineer seek to enhance systems availability by providing continuous monitoring of Windows,
Unix, Solaris, and Linux system components, thus improving the ability to operate an increasingly
complex system more efficiently. SMRC focuses on bringing fast problem resolution to NOAA endusers, and rapidly restoring functionality. When the mission includes running critical infrastructure that
supports important satellite systems, SMRC has expertise in the management of these devices. SMRC will provide all services as specified in the PWS for the following:
• GOES-R Satellite System located at Daniel K. Inouye Regional Center (IRC)
• Himawari-8/HimawariCast Satellite System located at Daniel K. Inouye Regional Center and at
the Weather Forecast Office (WFO) Guam
• JPSS Satellite System located at Daniel K. Inouye Regional Center and at the WFO Guam
SMRC will provide maintenance support for the satellite LDM server and processes that delivers
Himawari-8 high-resolution tiles, HimawariCast NetCDF-4 data, McIDAS McADDE remote data and
local data to the AWIPS. We will also provide maintence support for a Direct Broadcast Network
(DBNet) server for reception of non-baseline AWIPS model data from the NCEP. We will support and
configure the AWIPS to display supported satellite data. We will work closely with the satellite vender,
Harris Corporation, and University of Wisconsin Space Science Enginnering Center (SSEC) personnel on
configurations and warranty of satellite hardware and software.
SMRC has experience with operations and management of maintenance support contracts of hardware
including network devices, servers and specialized appliances as are used for signal processing. The
management of these devices must be coordinate as per operational schedules and sun avoidance/stray
light periods. In addition, develop plan in partnership with NWS program office, balancing needs of
various stakeholders and of core missions; ensure NWS policies, guidelines, and standards are
implemented and enforced; incorporate robust risk management activities with mitigation strategies; plan
to automate monitoring of IT infrastructure; plan for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance with
minimal impact on agency activities.
Configuration Management is extremely important in satellite environments as misconfiguration can lead
to mission compromise. SMRC will comply with all CM requirements. A strong CM framework
integrates all program elements into a stable environment SMRC finds that following a rigorous change
and release management process ensures changes are made properly, with stakeholder notification and
buy-in, and minimized downtime. A network is considered compliant, when its configuration meets all
standards, including those based on performance, configuration standardization and security. We have
successfully incorporated and followed government CM processes for a number of large high volume
networks for NOAA and many others. We follow and conform to government approved CM processes,
procedures, and established regular Configuration Control Board (CCB) meetings that baselines
documentation, ensures CM requests are completed by their due date, and operational systems are not
impacted by system upgrades, modifications, or changes. Documentation boarded at the CCB includes
checklists used to document the change purpose, justification, solution, proper testing and regression
testing, planned schedule, implementation and cutover procedures including back-out plan, and technical
performance and specifications. By doing so, the Government can be sure that all plans are approved and
minimize implementation risks. Baseline documentation also includes test documentation and test reports.
As activities are approved by the government, the CCB ensures installers are provided labels of host
names or identifiers for cables, peripheral equipment, and systems as listed in the CI database. 2.2.3.1 Department of Commerce (DoC), NOAA and NWS Policies 
SMRC has experience in creating and managing a full set of security controls for detecting, responding to, 
and preventing attacks through continuous security monitoring, stringent change control, secure baseline 
configurations, and actively managing vulnerabilities and threats. The delivered system had to meet the 
security technical requirements for a High Impact system as defined in NIST FIPS 199, FIPS 200, and SP 
800-53, as well as, ITSM, and System Security Plan. In addition to technical and security controls, 
SMRC will follow any other agency guidelines required for these positions 2.2.3.2 Linux Support 
SMRC’s talented engineers have in-depth experience in supporting Unix/Linux Server Operations (USO) 
including installation, configuration, upgrade, patching, implementation of STIGs, and maintenance of 
Apache and Tomcat web and other Unix servers. We will provide NWS with full lifecycle support by 
applying the broad brush approach for the USO installation, configuration and maintenance (jumpstart 
servers, Veritas Volume Manager, and sendmail configuration) of Linux (RedHat) and Unix (Solaris) 
servers. Our approach includes SolarWinds (or open source tools such as Nagios or Zabbix) for 
performance monitoring, alerts, and alarms. We will operate and administer NWS USO environment by 
verifying the backend servers are functioning as desired and all applicable patches, configuration changes, 
and updates with COR approval prior to scheduling down-time. We will perform and verify success of 
backups of all UNIX/Linux Servers per NOAA Security policy. We will monitor system logs daily to 
verify that systems are operating at peak performance. Prior to changes being made to USO, our engineers 
coordinate with the backup administrator who schedules special backups (back out plan). We open tickets 
for all instances of server downtime/ performance issues immediately upon discovery. We perform and 
document in the Maintenance Log all HW/SW repairs, upgrades, patches, and configuration changes 
made on any applications server/system component immediately upon completion of the repair. 
2.2.3.3 Identity and Access Management 
SMRC utilizes industry leading best practices in service-oriented architecture (SAO) to create enterprise 
systems including data processing and tracking systems that meet program needs. SMRC systems 
engineers administer methodologies tailored to the environment and establish change control procedures 
in a secure way that does not restrict progress and create obstacles to meeting NOAA’s scientific 
requirements. Our team employs scalable enterprise for users such as the Data Archive Centers to adapt to 
new and changing mission needs for years to come. In terms of security, we utilize Active Directory to 
authenticate and authorize all users and computers accessing the Environmental Satellite Processing 
Center networks at NOAA, which assists our System Administrators in enforcing computer security 
policies and enabling software installation and updates. In addition, SMRC utilizes agency-specific STIG 
hardening tools, CIS benchmarks, USGCB standards and Vulnerability Management Databases to ensure 
critical identity and access management components are secure. 
2.2.3.4 Security Tasks 
SMRC’s approach to security compliance is straightforward and covers both IT system level security and 
application level security. For IT System level, we engage the security accreditation team early and often 
to build security in at the beginning of every effort (when system waivers are not applicable). We 
recognize the lead times necessary for authority to operate (ATO) and we make sure that no external team 
will ever wait on us to deliver artifacts. During system categorization we build the necessary 
documentation to fully define Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) levels of High, Moderate, 
or Low, and then work with the external teams to define controls across the system. During system 
development we continuously assess, test, and scan those controls to ensure compliance at the appropriate 
CIA categorization. In addition, we proactively monitor CVE database for potential upcoming patches. 
2.2.3.5 System Management 
SMRC provides expert system administrative support for a wide variety of systems, including desktops, 
laptops, servers, storage, networks, and web maintenance. Although each system has unique support 
requirements, we implement a consistent support model for all system components, providing reliability, 
consistency, and availability. Our support model combines automated monitoring, alerting, and issue 
escalation to provide timely on-call and as-needed support for troubleshooting, maintenance, and 
proactive problem identification and resolution. 2.2.3.5.1 Provisioning 
Whether imaging a user workstation or preparing a web server, we will maintain and utilize standard, 
regularly maintained system images and documentation, providing consistently provisioned, stable, 
reliable systems. 
2.2.3.5.2 Hosting 
In addition to installing, configuring, documenting, and maintaining the web hosting servers and software, 
we will coordinate with the NWS staff to maintain and enhance the site content, monitor availability, 
report on activity, and suggest system enhancements to improve site stability and reliability. 
2.2.3.5.3 Monitoring 
We will review the NWS monitoring solutions and, if necessary, recommend, implement, and maintain an 
integrated monitoring solution, providing a single pane overview of all monitored systems. The 
monitoring solution will also provide multi-tiered alerting, notifications, and escalations based on both 
system failures and proactive analysis. 
2.2.3.5.4 Reporting 
We will report on a variety of system metrics, including system availability, system utilization, 
performance related issues, monitoring alerts, and issue resolution. On servers and storage, we will report 
system utilization and capacity trending. 
2.2.3.5.5 Hardware Maintenance 
We will coordinate systems maintenance with manufacturers and service providers, as necessary, to 
maintain all systems in proper working order, including required firmware updates and security 
vulnerability remediation. 
2.2.3.5.6 Remote Connectivity 
We will monitor and support the NWS remote connectivity solution to provide stable, reliable 
connectivity. 
2.2.3.5.7 Backups and Archiving

for Application Development Technology and Process Standards related to the development, 
testing, deployment, and operations of custom built applications at the FDA. The purpose of 
the milestone is to reduce the complexity of the application technology footprint while 
increasing transparency and efficiency of the process and governance surrounding it. The result 
of Application Development Technology and Process Standards will be a more consistent 
environment leading to simplified and less expensive development, operations, and 
maintenance. While the guidance and standards identified in this document may be applicable 
to current/existing systems and applications, they are intended primarily for development of 
new systems, tools, or applications. This document is meant to serve as a basis for future, 
more detailed documentation on each of the topics discussed below. Modular Technology ‐ Microservice Architecture (MSA)
Microservice architecture (MSA) is a method of developing software applications as a suite of 
independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process 
and communicates through a well‐defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal 
(Huston).
Touted as a more specific and focused (in terms of size and scope) subset of Service Oriented 
Architecture (SOA), MSA is “an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small 
services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, 
often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and 
independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum 
of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming 
languages and use different data storage technologies” (Fowler & Lewis, 2014). 
An example of MSA being applied to the monolithic architecture in Figure 1 can be seen in 
Figure 3. The example below has its functionality broken out into separate discrete services 
that, when combined, encompass and satisfy the business needs for the application. One of the 
key advantages of this design approach alongside the appropriate infrastructure technologies is 
the ability to move or migrate microservices between clouds and datacenters with ease. API Mediation
As modular architecture evolves into the use of MSA patterns as a set of distributed, loosely 
coupled, autonomous components, and multiple back‐end services that support the specific 
workflows required for each app, the use of APIs becomes inevitable. As a result, APIs have 
become fundamental to the application architecture. However, as powerful and flexible as APIs 
are, they can also introduce challenges if they are not properly managed. The following are key capabilities required by the API mediation layer: 
 Security: Needed to ensure API product safety and security 
o Authentication: Determines if the client program can utilize a service or API. In some 
cases, mutual authentication is required. 
o Authorization: Determines what the client program is permitted to request from the 
service or API (from a choice of several available API functions). 
o API protection: Protects APIs from attacks, including providing bot protection 
(against automated attacks). 
 Traffic management: Needed to ensure API product performance 
o Rate limiting: Creates and applies flexible quotas and rate‐limiting policies to APIs 
o Load balancing: Distributes workloads across multiple instances of replicated 
services that are implemented behind the API mediation layer 
 Orchestration: Needed to enable API product customization for different constituencies. 
o Data model mapping: Converts back‐end microservices to developer‐friendly APIs, 
supports composite microservices, or enriches part of a message before sending it to 
its destination. 
o Protocol mapping: Bidirectional protocol transformation, for example, between 
HTTP (REST) and SOAP, and AMQP and MQTT. 
 Monitoring: Needed to ensure API product performance and quality. 
o Analytics: Generates data concerning the traffic load, SLA metrics, performance of 
underlying services (real time and historical) along with customizable displays and 
analytics 
o Alerts: Generates warnings based on API usage events, such as clients hitting their 
quota limit 
o API usage plans: Applies usage plans such as subscriptions. 
 Developer support: Enhances the product experience 
o Developer portal: Searches for an API, registers it for use, samples client code, tests 
harnesses and test datasets for that API 
o API customization: Allows API consumers to create their own customized version of 
a published API (by selecting subsets of the message structure for the client/API 
interaction or reorganizing the message structure, for example) Mobile Technology ‐ Enterprise Mobile Application Development
Framework (MADF) Overview
The Enterprise Mobility Strategy at FDA provides key development and delivery support to 
enhance the success of mobility implementation across dimensions of People, Technology, and 
Process. Mobile application development projects face a myriad of challenges including 
platform diversity, security, usability. FDA has introduced the Mobility Application Development 
Framework (MADF) to address these challenges in a systematic way across the agency. 
The MADF provides a suite of guidelines and best practices to successfully plan, develop, 
manage and deliver mobile applications. It also provides guidance to stakeholders, throughout 
the project lifecycle, on how to determine the design approach, development processes, 
required mobility tools, and user interface that best fit their requirements. 
The mobile development process consists of the Project Intake, Development and Deployment 
processes. The exhibit below describes the process to promote a mobile app to the FDA and/or 
public app stores for distribution to a FDA end‐user (an employee, partner, collaborator, or the 
public). The workflow provides a high‐level approach to the steps required to initiate a request 
to develop a mobile app. 
The Mobile App Development Framework, along with other documents addressing all aspects 
of mobility governance is available at the FDA Mobility page. Issue Tracking JIRA

"Application Development Technology and 
Process Standards","1.2 Understanding of the NWS OWP Mission 
The Office of Water Prediction (OWP) collaboratively researches, develops and delivers state-of-thescience national hydrologic analyses, forecast information, data, decision-support services and guidance 
to support and inform essential emergency services and water management decisions. Part of this mission 
includes providing NOAA’s water forecast and information program via web sites and data services. 
Team SMRC will provide mission-critical support to: 
 Enhance, maintain, and support multiple web services deployed for NWS dissemination systems 
 Develop new functionality and web services (e.g. data services and geospatial data service) for 
products and information produced by the water forecast and information program and the 
National Weather Center (NWC) based on current technologies (BootStrap, JQuery etc) and will 
introduce new technologies as required. 
 Provide system/website monitoring and support to help ensure the NWC and the Advanced 
Hydrologic Prediction Services (AHPS) web services are functional 24x7x365 in coordination 
with other NWS support organizations using both port/process monitoring and external synthetic 
monitoring to ensure systems are online. 
 Develop and implement flood inundation map libraries for selected river locations coordinating 
with NWS HQ and field offices and other entities as required. 
 Lead the migration of legacy OHD web site information into the appropriate framework (OWP, 
vLab, etc.) and hosting environment and ensure functionality and access to data is preserved in 
the process. 
 Follow all appropriate DOC/NOAA/NWS security and development procedures, and interface 
with key stakeholders to ensure compliance 
with line office and OCIO security 
guidelines. 
OWP environment knowledge and expertise is 
provided by our subcontractor Lynker, who has 
provided hydrologic research, modeling and 
simulation, and systems development, 
enhancement, and operations since 2013. SMRC 
current performs similar work on our 
CoastWatch/OceanWatch (CWOW) project where 
our resources manage Open source web services in 
support of the program. Furthermore, SMRC 
delivers relevant customized business solutions for 
CWOW in an environment supporting Postgres 
Databases and Red Hat Linux. SMRC tailors 
project life cycles according to scope and 
complexity and uses a risk-based approach to 
oversight and project life cycles for CWOW. Our 
designs are sent to a review board where a risk 
assessment framework is utilized, including 
likelihood and impact. 
The resources on this program will work remotely 
and have expert skills in managing similar task 
orders. The resources have experience accessingremote environments via VPN and will ensure consistency in managing a geographically diverse set of 
services. The resources will have the following roles: 
Database Specialist – Will perform full lifecycle management of all databases supporting OWP, 
including MySQL, Postgres and new databases that may be introduced. The Database Specialist will also 
support any data ingest processes or data driven web services calls. 
Programmer Analyst – Will work with stakeholders to determine which requirements will make the 
release schedule and coordinate with the Web Designer/Developer for implementation. 
System Administrator – Will manage the web systems that comprise the OWP portfolio including 
monitoring, patch management and maintenance. Will assist in troubleshooting of Tier 2/3 issues. 
System Engineer – Will logically manage technical infrastructure that support the web portfolios in the 4 
data center locations. Will assist in troubleshooting of Tier 2/3 issues. 
Web Designer/Developer – Will ensure that the web portfolio are designed and developed with as much 
common code and reusability as feasible and in accordance with OWP and NOAA guidelines. 
GIS Specialist – Will ensure that the GIS related functionality of the website and server/client libraries 
(including ArcGIS/Esri) are functioning as expected and that the GIS functionality will work as designed 
with any future consolidation in mind. 
1.3 Capability to Manage the Fulfillment of the PWS Requirements 
The Team SMRC software development lifecycle has evolved over years to include both Waterfall and 
Agile methodologies. Depending on the effort, SMRC can deliver using either approach in compliance 
with SDLC phases while adhering to the stage gates and reviews. SMRC is currently engaged in multiple 
development efforts at NOAA using both Waterfall and Agile approaches. In all cases we work with 
branch leadership and the program COR to establish the proper level of tailoring to the necessary 
documentation, ensuring that process does not hinder progress. Figure 4 gives a high-level overview of 
how we execute in either model. While many Agile approaches use similar constructs backlogs, retrospectives, user stories, and burndown 
charts, SMRC’s approach ties these constructs to tools, specific technology stacks, and user engagement 
throughout the process. SMRC understands the typical architecture of CMS systems and understands that 
the OWP stack is comprised of the following components: 
 Bootstrap Base theme Framework 
 External Javascript libraries including JQuery and others 
 Custom Javascript libraries 
 Google Analytics API 
 Red Hat Linux, PostGres/MySQL DB, Apache and PHP (LAMP stack) 
 Support for Web Services for data integration from external systems 
In addition to stable web design and architecture, a sound systems design is only one part of an overall 
security services solution; it still requires execution in a timely and fully-deployed service to be useful. 
Our solution, using SMRC’s proven security system design life cycle (SSDLC) process, allows for the 
ability to ensure successful system deployment and support to the OWP Cyber Security Program Manager 
(CSPM), or individual system owners as directed by the Office of the Assistant Chief Information Officer 
– Satellites (OACIO-S) in providing general security architecture support throughout the SSDLC. Figure 
5 illustrates our approach to mapping security into every aspect of the SDLC process and is relevant in 
both large and small development workflowsTeam SMRC database specialists will install, maintain, upgrade, and query all OWP databases ensuring 
that the critical services are available to meet customer needs 24x7. SMRC has numerous successful 
experiences supporting mission critical databases and applications. Our expert database engineers provide 
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) installation of MySQL, Postgres and other Open 
source databases, configuration, and integration and maintenance support to automate business at various 
TOPR # EA-133W-18-RQ-0154 | Volume 1: Technical Approach | March 7, 2018

7 
clients. We also provide professional user technical support daily (including escalated support) related to 
database system access/problems, including personal computer (PC) hardware and internet browsers. Our 
approach includes testing security patches/STIGs test/pro-prod prior to installation into the production 
environment. This includes RDBMS, Forms, Applications Server, Business Intelligence Server which 
ensures consistency and provides reliable database service for OWP customers 24x7. On our 
CoastWatch/OceanWatch contract, we have experience managing data feed/ingest processes from 
external sources (Satellite, sensor) using protocols such as FTP, HTTPS, rsync, and others for a variety of 
formats that are used with web services and processed, transformed or utilized for visualizations and other 
purposes. 
SMRC has experience with maintaining and querying large scale and complex databases. Adequately 
supporting data owners and data stakeholders in a database environment requires database administrators 
(DBA) to construct and maintain SQL and PL/SQL. SMRC’s DBAs have expertise in this arena and 
leverage best practices including the following: 
 Reducing code redundancies 
 Modularizing where feasible to reduce code complexity and increase maintainability 
 Leveraging top-down design where possible 
 Applying the optimizer where necessary to determine the best execution plan for the query 
 Simplifying procedures, variables and comments as necessary 
Specifically with managing open source databases that are used to support web environments under 
FISMA designation, there are also a number of best practices that SMRC will follow in accordance with 
OWP and OCIO security guidance, including the following: 
 Authentication and Password Policies 
 Authorization and Privilege Management 
 Encryption to secure sensitive data 
 Enterprise Firewall to block database attacks such as a SQL Injection 
 Enterprise Audit to implement policy-based auditing compliance 
 Database Hardening Best Practices 
SMRC provides Database Administration (DBA) 
support to development, applications, testing, training, 
and production databases. This experience 
encompasses installation, maintenance, patching, and 
upgrading databases. In addition to managing the 
database itself, SMRC will manage the governance of 
the data. The goal of Data Management planning is to 
ensure that data is properly documented, made 
accessible, and preserved for future use. NOAA 
Administrative Order (NAO) 212-15, Management of 
Environmental Data and Information, states that 
environmental data is to be managed based upon a 
lifecycle that includes developing and following a Data 
Management Plan (DM Plan). SMRC will follow this 
directive, which directs managers of all data production 
or data collection programs and systems to ensure data 
management plans are developed for their data. NAO 212-15 provides a template with questions to be 
addressed regarding NOAA environmental data which SMRC uses if data specification or consolidation 
efforts are required. 1.3.1.2 Provide Information in Geospatial Formats and Traditional Web-services and Perform 
Geospatial Analyses and Develop Geospatial Analytical Tools (PWS 4.1.3, 4.1.6) 
Team SMRC will perform Geospatial Analyses and develop associated analytical Tools. SMRC has 
previously provided geospatial support by having provisioned and administered Linux utilities in support 
of Open Geospatial Consortium services including GEOSERVER and MAPSERVER on the NOAA 
CoastWatch/OceanWatch (CWOW) program, where we assess map server technologies consolidation to 
reduce complexity and improve an open source architecture. Our team is experienced in analyzing and 
piloting new Web Feature Services (WFS), such as OpenGeo Suite and Grass GIS, to modernize NOAA 
web-based applications. Newer OGC services can support data sharing, keeping the underlying MAPSET 
on a central server and enabling teams to simultaneously work in the same database. We also have 
experience with libraries and functionality of well known toolkits from ESRI and ArcGIS. 
1.3.1.3 Support and Expand the Existing OWP Software Infrastructure (PWS 4.1.4) 
With a strong web design and development background, SMRC brings an experienced workforce of 
certified Web Engineers with backgrounds in security who have worked on CMS platforms. SMRC will 
provide the necessary design, development, strategy, integration, migrations, upgrades, support and 
maintenance to sustain this critical OWP web presence. 
Team SMRC understands that open source systems, such as open source web systems, require close 
monitoring as there is often no commercial or vendor support, but broad community support. We have 
extensive experience in maintaining these open source systems. For example, our team has ample 
experience in implementing web solutions based on Bootstrap, Jquery, Vaading and also CMS systems 
such as WordPress and Drupal 7.x and 8.x.as well as operating and maintaining these web environment. 
SMRC provides technical support for development, implementation, and operation and maintenance 
while adhering to Federal Security policy, including FISMA and Section 508. 
SMRC ensures the CMS environment adheres to 
IT security policy which includes scheduled 
maintenance and patching and close monitoring 
of any security vulnerabilities that need to be 
patched. SMRC will also coordinate with the 
necessary stakeholders to ensure that 
maintenance windows are communicated well in 
advance. Additionally, SMRC will provide a 
knowledge platform where Wiki, Support and 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be 
housed related to the management of the CMS 
System. SMRC will also provide and support 
proactive implementation plans for maintaining 
the CMS sites online, operational and compliant 
with federal security requirements. 
SMRC will provide progress reports with detailed schedules and deliverables and demonstration of web 
development/maintenance progress and can adhere to an Agile development model that allows a Scrum 
Meeting (daily), Backlog Refinement grooming (1 or 2 per Sprint), Sprint planning (1 or 2 per Sprint), 
Demo or Review (end of Sprint) and Review (end of Sprint) 
SMRC has been hands-on in several implementations and will ensure the following items are considered 
as part of overall environment management: 
 System Backups. With any open source CMS, backing up the site, both at the file system level 
and at the DB level, is imperative. Additionally, restoration tests are needed at least annually to",1
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) ,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) has an ongoing requirement for TSA Systems Integration Facility (TSIF) Development Testing Support Services.

BACKGROUND

The Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) supports TSA's mission by providing security capabilities to the field. OSC continues to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our nation's transportation systems through the qualification and deployment of security capabilities that drive the global standard for security.

The TSA OSC previously awarded multiple IDIQs for Test and Evaluation Support Services (TESS) to two (2) awardees: TASC, Inc. (HSTS0410DST3065) and Battelle Memorial Institute (HSTS0410DST3066). Battelle is providing the TSIF Testing Support Services.

SMRC_Volume 1 Business Solution_NCNA2400-17-00792,"1.02 Objectives: The overall objective of this task is to obtain contractor support to supplement the specialized CHPS support â€œhelp
deskâ€ functions performed by the Hydrology Support Group (HSG) in the Office of Central Processing (OCP) Field Support and
Infrastructure Team (FSIT). The HSG provides Tier 1 and Tier 2 support for the CHPS operations at RFCs. The contract staff works
alongside the federal HSG members, and the specific task requirements are provided by the HSG staff. Historically, the full CHPS
support has been handled by a team consisting of 2-3 federal employees supplemented by (2) contract employees. Significant
coordination between HSG staff and the RFCs and other support providers within the NWS enterprise is required, using verbal and
written forms of communication, in order to effectively provide the customer support.
The contractor provides technical support to ensure the operational performance and integrity of CHPS. This support includes the
following objectives:
1) Provide specialized â€œhelp-deskâ€ technical support whereby operational problems, issues, and questions are presented to the
contractor for resolution. Support will be provided in the form of problem tracking, problem analysis, and ultimately
problem resolution for CHPS issues (a.k.a. â€œticketsâ€ or â€œcasesâ€) reported by the RFCs. This support can be provided by
action taken on an RFC computer system, direct communication to RFC staff, or advice and instructions which address the
reported problem. Communication may include direct phone conversations, e-mail, or software documentation. The â€œhelpdeskâ€
problem resolution typically involves relatively specific issues reported with CHPS which often require prompt
attention.
2) Provide technical support for NWS projects associated with CHPS. This can include projects related to the CHPS software
system environment, the CHPS hardware configuration, or the hydrometeorologic functions embodied within CHPS. The
project support typically involves more general needs of the CHPS operations, and generally do not require immediate
attention. These project outcomes result in more stable, more efficient operation of CHPS at RFCs.
3) Provide technical guidance (written and verbal), training, and coordination of operational functions in a pro-active manner,
including monitoring and preventative maintenance of systems executing the CHPS software suite. Collectively, these
activities result in a support enterprise that promotes a high level of competence for operational readiness, competence, and
awareness among RFC users of CHPS.
These objectives comprise part of and are consistent with the formal operating plan goal of the NWS to â€œProvide 24 x 7 support to
address operational issues related to AWIPS and CHPS hydrologic software at 13 RFCs and 122 WFOsâ€. The end result of the
completed objectives is the stable and functional operation of the NWS RFC river forecasting services provided by CHPS. This
operation allows formal NWS products to be issued and NWS services to be provided to the other NWS offices, the public, and the nationâ€™s water resource enterprise. Note that this task does not involve direct support for NWS WFOs (Weather Forecast Office),
which execute AWIPS, but do execute CHPS.",1

Note: The Government at its discretion may place the SDP on contract. Refer to Appendix I for suggested SDP content.

– In addition to aligning our processes to a standard Waterfall methodology, we propose to expand the use of Agile Scrum-based processes into our development methodology. Working with the Federal Web App Team lead, we will work to adopt iterative sprints that rapidly adapt to change rather than predicting unanticipated change, thereby focusing on customer satisfaction through quick and cyclic delivery of production-ready software components. Utilizing this methodology, software specifications are derived from established user stories, and as development sprints are completed, we perform code reviews, testing, and Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) to facilitate deployment into the production environment. Some of the benefits of an agile approach are:
 Production ready software that provides business value to system users as rapidly as possible.
 Clear requirements from meetings between government stakeholders and RIVA project staff
 Reprioritization of functional and non-functional requirements within each sprint cycle, reducing associated rework costs by aligning iterative releases with user stories and needs
 Adapt quickly to frequent or significant changes in projects while continuing to deliver
 Incorporation of emerging technologies into the solution.
Using an Agile-based development model, RIVA facilitates QC by considering relevant aspects of the development process, improving solution quality iteratively, documenting the system as it is developed, and being cognizant of compliance requirements such as existing TRMs, Service Level Architecture Guidelines, and security mandates. We perform work in two to four-week sprints. Each sprint begins with a Sprint Planning meeting to prioritize and assign product backlog items to the sprint backlog. We conduct daily Scrum Meetings or “stand ups” to discuss short term tasking and identify project obstacles to manage and escalate activities to the appropriate person. At the completion of each sprint, we conduct a Sprint Review meeting to demonstrate functionality that was developed and document stakeholder feedback for incorporation into the next sprint cycle. We hold Sprint Retrospective meetings to document lessons learned and adjust processes and procedures as needed.
Team RIVA understands that NCCOS has a centralized inventory and key attributes of applications, databases, and websites. As part of our support, we maintain and update this inventory to provide transparency into NCCOS systems and as requested and perform assessments of identified items within the inventory to provide guidance on future technological objectives. Some of these initiatives include feasibility assessments for migrating additional applications, data, and websites to cloud hosted solutions such as MS Azure; conducting security/risk assessments to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate negative outcomes; performing technology obsolescence/refresh studies to identify future strategies; and addressing skill set gaps and other operational risks. We work with NCCOS scientists, product owners, and end users to implement and manage the initiatives for GIS software and support the development and maintenance of applications based upon spatially referenced data and digital mapping.
For feasibility, technology, and migration assessments, we prepare proposals for recommended solutions to remediate any issues known or identified. For new project requests, we assist NCCOS staff in evaluating the request, the current team skill sets, capabilities, and availability, and existing partnerships to identify the appropriate solution to meet the request. These requests are captured and tracked in a centralized product backlog and are identified as new development, enhancement, or defect/change request and is maintained using the NCCOS BMC TrackIt ticketing system and Google Drive products. Once the course of action has been reviewed and approved, our team supports the necessary design and development of the solution and works with the product owner to ensure mission goals and objectives are met. This includes supporting and facilitating NCCOS staff for Branch or Partner led development efforts to improve enterprise system performance and availability. Prior to deployment into the production environment, we work with NCCOS to conduct integration and functional testing and any major issues are addressed before migration and that we receive approval from the CCB. For existing applications, databases, and websites, we perform corrective and adaptive maintenance to ensure compliance with technology goals, security requirements, and NOS policy and standards.
Throughout the development process, we follow NOS Configuration Management processes and industry best practices to maintain proper version control for all development, test, and production version of software and systems to allow for traceability and proper support and installation of deployment packages. We manage software code repositories to maintain all development, test and production versions of software, applications, and websites. Software versioning (unique version names or numbers assigned to each unique state of software) is implemented as part of this process and kept in an official Git repository provided by the Government. In addition, we use the SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) for secure remote login from one computer to another. This protocol will be used to access government-controlled Git repositories and Git deployment of all application code from Git repositories to Azure webapps. We maintain strict SSL access control to all SQL and MySQL databases. We maintain and update system documentation based on changes in a content management system.

configuration IMAC.
 Ensure that all like components in NOS networks are mirrored at the same software, firmware,
and engineering levels at all sites.
Configuration management is a complex task, normally expedited with automated tools, rigorous quality
checks, and integration with other processes. The SMRC Team will support, follow, and conform to
NOS-approved configuration management (CM) processes and procedures.
Accounting/Administration Management—The SMRC Team will perform all tasks associated with the
proper accounting and administration management of NOS networks. To ensure successful accounting
and administration, we will:
 Maintain multi-user account management for all NOS network components, log configuration
changes per user, and obtain ISSO approval when administrators are added to or removed from
the system.
 Process account request forms, configuration change requests, and other NOS-approved network
administration procedures.
 Administer the appropriate access to all NOS network devices using secured methods approved
by the ISSO.
 Work with NOS to create and update inventories, rack elevations and equipment room layouts.
 Develop and maintain diagrams of all WAN and LAN data communication connections
including, but not limited to external point to point data communication circuits, Internet
connections, and other dedicated high-bandwidth connections.
 Maintain a baseline configuration of the NOS network and plan for technology insertion by
recommending new technologies and improvements in a Technical Improvement Plan.
 Insert meaningful descriptions for switch and router port configurations and configuration details
using the network equipment’s Internetwork Operating System (IOS).Label network cabling and equipment following NOS-approved naming convention.
 Manage and troubleshoot all approved public and private Domain Naming Service (DNS) name
spaces that are owned and operated by the NOS CIO’s office. This includes obtaining domain and
IP space from the NOAA NOC, managing and assigning the proper IP address to correspond to
the correct domain names, and updating DNS names and entries.
 Manage, track, and report on all DHCP and static IP addresses reservations within NOS.

 Utilize two-factor authentication methods for remote users.
Providing administration of a network’s physical and logical resources is a core competency for SMRC’s
Team on such programs as the Network Operations Center at NOAA.
In cooperation with the government and per government standards, we will:
 Acquire equipment to update inventories and log into the asset management system for life-cycle
tracking.
 Maintain drawings of rack elevations, room layouts, wiring diagrams, cable runs, port
connections, and LAN/WAN data communication connections (e.g., point-to-point, Internet,
circuit/packet switched, dedicated fiber) in accordance with the NOAA Technical Reference
Model (TRM) for network and system changes.
 Monitor network capacity and resource usage to recommend, plan and execute expansion.
Performance Management—SMRC believes in a network management approach that relies on vigilance
to detect and address network issues prior to their leading to a system failure. Our Team will;
 Provide reports on NOS network components to include but not limited to availability, resource
utilization, and system performance to NOS on a weekly basis.
 Provide weekly, monthly and yearly network utilization reports for all external data connections

 Follow the documented guidance from NOS System Security Plans (SSPs) for patching all
systems.
SMRC understands the importance of protecting critical information and will inspect, test and apply
security patches, hot fixes, service pack updates and resolve all vulnerabilities with specific security
controls. We will maintain security awareness 7x24x365 to eliminate vulnerabilities and threats to the
overall environment and to many government organizations that touch or connect to NOS networks. Our
security provides real-time security event management and reporting, including monitoring firewalls, and
audit logs. If an anomalous event is detected, the security analyst creates a service ticket. Critical security
events are escalated immediately to NOS ISSOs and NOAA N-CIRT according to NOAA Incident
Reporting Procedures. Based on security policy, we will work with NOS ISSOs and stakeholders in
determining required security program elements that already exist or need to be created and for ensuring
that software, firmware, and engineering revision levels of NOS network components comply at least
with minimum levels required by NOAA and NOS security policy.
2.2.2.1.2 Emerging Technologies and Innovation
Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is a new architecture with centralized automation and
policy-driven application profiles. ACI delivers software flexibility with the scalability of hardware
performance which ultimately could end up with greater network portability and agility for NOS. In
addition, Cisco ACI aligns well with DevOps and rapid application change environments. An ACI
environment includes Cisco Nexus Series Switches, an Application Policy Infrastructure Controller
(APIC), a Cisco Application Virtual Switch (AVS) and will allow the following operational
improvements:
 Simplified automation by an application-driven policy model
 Centralized visibility with real-time, application health monitoring
 Open software flexibility for DevOps teams and ecosystem partner integration
 Scalable performance and multi-tenancy in hardware
ACI ultimately can lead to a reduction of complexity and a common policy framework that can automate
provisioning and managing of resources in NOS Operational environments.",1

Technology refresh plan including a short term and long term roadmap Replaces the section 3.3 tiered security zone system (Presentation, Application, and Data)
with security zones that are directly connected to the Core/Transport zone.
• Greatly reduces traffic flows which must cross multiple zone boundaries (Firewalls).
• Eliminates the necessity for policy routing (solves issue with Checkpoint IPv6
support).
• Consolidates the Presentation and Application tiers into a single zone to reduce
application flow complexity.
• Simplifies Firewall rule requests.
2. Reduces the number of physically separated zones and expands the number of Logically
separated zones.
• Significantly reduces OPEX expenditures.
• Increases utilization levels of existing equipment.
3. Consolidates the multiple Citrix deployments in each environment with a single Citrix
Virtual Application/Virtual Desktop deployment in the Enterprise Services Network
(ESN).
• Separate use cases (virtual application and virtual desktop groups) will be deployed to
maintain security isolation.
• Separation per zone is maintained by having separate Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
(VDI) groups per zone.
4. Connects physical server resources (blade chassis and blades) to multiple security zones.
• Improves utilization levels of servers within the data centers.
• Allows for flexibility in physical server placement within the data centers.
• VMs would only be required to have one virtual network interface. Separate
Management, Backup and Recovery (BUR), and other interfaces will be optional.
5. Relocates load balancers outside of the security zone to the Transport zone.
• Load balancers will now be inline instead of one-armed.
o This allows security inspection tools to log the original source IP of all traffic.
o Performance metric tools will be able to analyze to the original client source.

• Load balancers can be leveraged for multiple security zones by providing physical
separation at the NIC level.
6. Re-homes security zone virtual local area networks (VLANs) from routers to Firewalls.
• Eliminates the requirement of routers within security zones.
• Nexus 5000 infrastructure can be used for switching – no separate routing
functionality is required.
• Multiple VLANs in the same security zone would have open Firewall rules.
7. Reduces or eliminates multiple network interfaces on virtual machines (VMs).
• All traffic will be permitted to traverse a single “production” interface, simplifying
host configuration.
• Management traffic will be restricted to originate from Citrix or VDI.
• Backups will be performed at the vSphere or storage level.
8. Eliminates dedicated proxy devices within the security zones and leverages the Agencywide Websense proxies.
• Provides cost savings, while still maintaining the capability for access by exception.
• Provides a single point of management for user and server policy to External

Attachment B – Performance Work Statement (PWS),"In this phase, enterprise architects should ask following questions: 

• What are the different storage options available in the cloud today? 
• What are the different RDBMS (commercial and open source) options available in the cloud today? 
• What is my data segmentation strategy? What trade-offs do I have to make? 
• How much effort (in terms new development, one-off scripts) is required to migrate all my data to the cloud? 
When choosing the appropriate storage option, one size does not fit all. There are several dimensions that you might have to consider so that your application can scale to your needs appropriately with minimal effort. You have to make the right tradeoffs among various dimensions - cost, durability, query-ability, availability, latency, performance (response time), relational (SQL joins), size of object stored (large, small), accessibility, read heavy vs. write heavy, update frequency, cache-ability, consistency (strict, eventual) and transience (short-lived). Weigh your trade-offs carefully, and decide which ones are right for your application. The beauty about AWS is that it doesn’t restrict you to use one service or another. You can use any number of the AWS storage options in any combination. 

If your existing infrastructure consists of Fileservers, Log servers, Storage Area Networks (SANs) and systems that are backing up the data using tape drives on a periodic basis, you should consider storing this data in Amazon S3. Existing applications can utilize Amazon S3 without major change. If your system is generating data every day, the recommended migration flow is to point your “pipe” to Amazon S3 so that new data is stored in the cloud right away. Then, you can have an independent batch process to move old data to Amazon S3. Most enterprises take advantage of their existing encryption tools (256-bit AES for data at-rest, 128-bit SSL for data in-transit) to encrypt the data before storing it on Amazon S3. 
Migrate your MySQL Databases to Amazon RDS 

If you use a standard deployment of MySQL, moving to Amazon RDS will be a trivial task. Using all the standard tools, you will be able to move and restore all the data into an Amazon RDS DB instance. After you move the data to a DB instance, make sure you are monitoring all the metrics you need. It is also highly recommended that you set your retention period so AWS can automatically create periodic backups. 

Migrate your Commercial Databases to Amazon EC2 using Relational DB AMIs 

If you require transactional semantics (commit, rollback) and are running an OLAP system, simply use traditional migration tools available with Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2 and Informix. All of the major databases are available as Amazon Machine Images and are supported in the cloud by the vendors. Migrating your data from an on-premise installation to an Amazon EC2 cloud instance is no different than migrating data from one machine to another. 

Move Large Amounts of Data using Amazon Import/Export Service 

When transferring data across the Internet becomes cost or time prohibitive, you may want to consider the AWS Import/Export service With AWS Import/Export Service, you load your data on USB 2.0 or eSATA storage devices and ship them via a carrier to AWS. AWS then uploads the data into your designated buckets in Amazon S3. 

For example, if you have multiple terabytes of log files that need to be analyzed, you can copy the files to a supported device and ship the device to AWS. AWS will restore all the log files in your designated bucket in Amazon S3, which can then be fetched by your cloud-hosted business intelligence application or Amazon Elastic MapReduce services for analysis. 

If you have a 100TB Oracle database with 50GB of changes per day in your data center that you would like to migrate to AWS, you might consider taking a full backup of the database to disk then copying the backup to USB 2.0 devices and shipping them. Until you are ready to switch the production DBMS to AWS, you take differential backups. The full backup is restored by the import service and your incremental backups are transferred over the Internet and applied to the DB Instance in the cloud. Once the last incremental backup is applied, you can begin using the new database server. 
In this phase, you should ask the following question: 

• How can I move part of or an entire system to the cloud without disrupting or interrupting my current business? 
In this phase, you will learn two main application migration strategies: Forklift Migration Strategy and Hybrid Migration Strategy. We will discuss the pros and cons of each strategy to help you decide the best approach that suits your application. Based on the classification of application types (in Phase 1), you can decide which strategy to apply for what type of application. 

Forklift Migration Strategy 

Stateless applications, tightly coupled applications, or self-contained applications might be better served by using the forklift approach. Rather than moving pieces of the system over time, forklift or “pick it all up at once” and move it to the cloud. Self-contained Web applications that can be treated as single components and backup/archival systems are examples of these types of systems that can be moved into the cloud using this strategy. Components of a 3-tier web application that require extremely-low latency connectivity between them to function and cannot afford internet latency might be best suited to this approach if the entire application including the web, app and database servers, is moved to the cloud all at once. 

In this approach, you might be able to migrate an existing application into the cloud with few code changes. Most of the changes will involve copying your application binaries, creating and configuring Amazon Machine Images, setting up security groups and elastic IP addresses, DNS, switching to Amazon RDS databases. This is where AWS’s raw infrastructure services (Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS and Amazon VPC) really shine. 

In this strategy, the applications might not be able to take immediate advantage of the elasticity and scalability of the cloud because, after all, you are swapping real physical servers with EC2 instances, or replacing file servers with Amazon S3 buckets or Amazon EBS volumes; logical components matter less than the physical assets. However, it’s important to realize that, by using this approach for certain application types, you are shrinking your IT infrastructure footprint (one less thing to worry about) and offloading the undifferentiated heavy lifting to AWS. This enables you to focus your resources on things that actually differentiate you from your competitors. You will revisit this application in the next stages and will be able to realize even more benefits of the cloud. 

Like with any other migration, having a backup strategy, a rollback strategy and performing end-to-end testing is a must when using this strategy. 

Hybrid Migration Strategy 

A hybrid migration consists of taking some parts of an application and moving them to the cloud while leaving other parts of the application in place. 

The hybrid migration strategy can be a low-risk approach to migration of applications to the cloud. Rather than moving the entire application at once, parts can be moved and optimized one at a time. This reduces the risk of unexpected behavior after migration and is ideal for large systems that involve several applications. For example, if you have a website and several batch processing components (such as indexing and search) that power the website, you can consider using this approach. The batch processing system can be migrated to the cloud first while the website continues to stay in the traditional data center. The data ingestion layer can be made “cloud-aware” so that the data is directly fed to an Amazon EC2 instance of the batch processing system before every job run. After proper testing of the batch processing system, you can decide to move the website application. 
In this strategy, you might have to design, architect and build temporary “wrappers” to enable communication between parts residing in your traditional datacenter and those that will reside in the cloud. These wrappers can be made “cloud- aware” and asynchronous (using Amazon SQS queues, wherever applicable) so that they are resilient to changing internet latencies. 

This strategy can also be used to integrate cloud applications with other cloud-incompatible legacy applications (Mainframe applications or applications that require specialized hardware to function). In this case, you can write 
“cloud-aware” web service wrappers around the legacy application and expose them as web service. Since web ports are accessible from outside enterprise networks, the cloud applications can make a direct call to these web services and which in turn interacts with the mainframe applications. You can also setup a VPN tunnel between the legacy applications that reside on-premise and cloud applications. 

Configuring and Creating your AMIs 

In many cases, it is best to begin with AMIs either provided by AWS or by a trusted solution provider as the basis of AMIs you intend to use going forward. Depending on your specific requirements, you may also need to leverage AMIs provided by other ISVs. In any case, the process of configuring and creating your AMIs is the same. 

It is recommended that you create an AMI for each component designed to run in a separate Amazon EC2 instance. It is also recommended to create an automated or semi-automated deployment process to reduce the time and effort for re- bundling AMIs when new code is released. This would be a good time to begin thinking about a process for configuration management to ensure your servers running in the cloud are included in your process.At minimum, you can create an Auto Scaling group and set a condition that your Auto Scaling group will always contain a fixed number of instances. Auto Scaling evaluates the health of each Amazon EC2 instance in your Auto Scaling group and automatically replaces unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances to keep the size of your Auto Scaling group constant. 

Amazon CloudFront 
With just a few clicks or command line calls, you can create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for any of your Amazon S3 buckets. This will edge cache your static objects closer to the customer and reduce latency. This is often so easy to do that customers don’t wait until this phase to take advantage of CloudFront; they do so much earlier in the plan. The Migrating to CloudFront4 whitepaper gives you more information. 

Amazon Elastic MapReduce 
For analyzing any large dataset or processing large amount of media, one can take advantage of Amazon Elastic MapReduce. Most enterprises have metrics data to process or logs to analyze or large data sets to index. With Amazon Elastic MapReduce, you can create repeatable job flows that can launch a Hadoop cluster, process the job, expand or shrink a running cluster and terminate the cluster all in few clicks. 

Automate Elasticity 

Elasticity is a fundamental property of the cloud. To understand elasticity and learn about how you can build architectures that supports rapid scale up and scale down, refer to the Architecting for the cloud whitepaper5. Elasticity can be implemented at different levels of the application architecture. Implementing elasticity might require refactoring and decomposing your application into components so that it is more scalable. The more you can automate elasticity in your application, the easier it will be to scale your application horizontally and therefore the benefit of running it in the cloud is increased. 

In this phase, you should try to automate elasticity. After you have moved your application to AWS and ensured that it works, there are 3 ways to automate elasticity at the stack level. This enables you to quickly start any number of application instances when you need them and terminate them when you don’t, while maintaining the application upgrade process. Choose the approach that best fits your software development lifestyle. 

1. Maintain Inventory of AMIs 
It’s easiest and fastest to setup inventory of AMIs of all the different configurations but difficult to maintain as newer versions of applications might mandate updating the AMIs. 
2. Maintain a Golden AMI and fetch binaries on boot 
This is a slightly more relaxed approach where a base AMI (“Golden Image”) is used across all application types across the organization while the rest of the stack is fetched and configured during boot time. 
3. Maintain a Just-Enough-OS AMI and a library of recipes or install scripts 
This approach is probably the easiest to maintain especially when you have a huge variety of application stacks to deploy. In this approach, you leverage the programmable infrastructure and maintain a library of install scripts that are executed on-demand.

to003 imet,"Integration services are becoming 
increasingly important to achieving 
Federal goals in healthcare delivery and 
biomedical research. The healthcare IT 
landscape is a complex public-private 
system that supports health agencies at 
the Federal, state, local, tribal, and 
territorial level, as well as surveillance 
and biomedical research efforts. In the 
health services space and biomedical 
research space, agencies must balance 
free availability of public health 
information, efficient sharing across 
systems of sensitive patient health and 
financial data, and the necessity of 
robust protection of this infrastructure 
from a variety of threats. 
RIVA’s experience and skills can 
contribute at each stage of the healthcare 
systems integration process by: 
• Assessing requirements with proper 
elicitation and analysis of current “as is” status; 
• Integrating strategy, architecture and solutions with fast results by performing gap analysis and solutions 
research, A-76 review and development of transition plan to ensure alignment of agency requirements with 
KPI-driven tasks and workstreams; and 
• Leading a successful implementation with solutions and services to efficiently and securely use big data 
analyses or manage outsourcing. 
The IT environment is adapting to the reality of a distributed private-public infrastructure with increased availability 
of solutions using open source software, rapid acceptance of cloud computing helped by the Federal Risk and 
Authorization Management program (FedRAMP), and a proliferation of “-as-a-Service” application as well as 
Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) and Data Platform as a Service (dPaaS). RIVA brings the technical 
experience in IT integration services that enabled the HHS ecosystem to provide better patient care, improve remote 
availability and enable telemedicine. We can create economies of scale under the cloud-based iPaaS/dPaaS 
integration model, enabling the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any 
hardware or middleware. A comprehensive sampling of our work to be performed under this Task Area is shown 
below.

"FDA Target State Architecture v1.0 September 2014 
","The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Directorate has a continuing requirement for nuclear safety cross check analysis, performance analysis and technical evaluation, independent verification and validation contract.

BACKGROUND
The Minuteman III (MMIII) is a mature weapon system that is in the Operations and Support Phase of its life cycle. As a critical leg in the strategic nuclear triad, the ICBM Weapon System requires continued sustainment of the critical software to ensure operational capabilities are maintained and new war-fighter requirements are implemented and independently certified for operational nuclear surety. The ICBM weapon system software requires updates and independent nuclear certification to provide a supportable and functional weapon system through 2075. The NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor independently assesses that nuclear critical software will only perform as intended: There has been no intentional/unintentional sabotage, and will not cause any unintended nuclear consequences.

Based on historical data, the anticipated workload is expected to be approximately 85% NSCCA/PATE and 15% IV&V.

REQUIREMENTS
Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis/Performance Analysis and Technical Evaluation/Independent Verification and Validation

Nuclear critical software evaluations are accomplished through NSCCA and IV&V code review, simulation testing, and deep analysis. Although these evaluations use many similar techniques, they typically have different requirements and, consequently, the analysis and reporting are different. Since NSCCA affects software that is nuclear critical, the contractor needs to consider that a significant majority of the effort under this PWS will be slanted toward NSCCA efforts and that IV&V efforts are subsidiary to NSCCA. IV&V efforts typically involve programs that support nuclear critical software. The analysis under IV&V ensures compliance with requirements levied on the software being studied. PATE efforts, currently not mandated by the Safety Center, are considered in parallel with other analysis. Both NSCCA and IV&V are performed by an organization that is technically, managerially, and financially independent of the developer. The AFSEC/SEW will make the final determination regarding independence requirements.

Nuclear safety design certified software is evaluated according to the Government Certification Requirements Plan (CRP). AFMAN 91-119, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems Software, provides criteria for NSCCA evaluation. Requirements for software evaluation can range from full NSCCA to IV&V/NSATE to qualification testing, depending on the relationship to critical functions such as authorization, pre-arming, launching, releasing, arming, and targeting. Requirements for software evaluation can change according to the current Air Force directives. ALL current Air Force nuclear certification requirements must be integrated and followed and are to be followed by the NSCCA contractor as soon as declared in force unless exempted by waiver.

NSCCA and IV&V evaluations will parallel the development lifecycle with incremental deliveries of requirements, design, and code changes from the program and developers as defined at task order level.

Nuclear Surety

The Air Force uses the DoD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program definition for Nuclear Weapons Surety: Policies, procedures, controls, and actions that encompass safety, security, and control measures which ensure there will be no nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, or degradation of weapon effectiveness during its lifecycle. The contractor shall comply with requirements listed in Appendix B: Applicable Compliance/Reference Documents.

The contractor shall support the Government in maintaining its ICBM Nuclear Certification Program IAW requirements detailed in DoD Directive (DoDD) 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapon Surety Program, DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program Manual, and AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.

Tools Sustainment

The contractor shall maintain and modify Government Furnished Property (GFP) (see Section 5: Property Management) that is provided in support of ICBM NSCCA/PATE IV&V task orders. The objectives of NSCCA/PATE/IV&V tools include accelerating analyses, reducing Government Test Lab needs by the NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor, and the ability to confirm anomalies that are difficult to or cannot be replicated in the Government labs.

Program Support

The contractor shall maintain technical, managerial, and financial independence from ICBM Program software developers IAW AFI 91-103. The Air Force Safety Center, Weapons Safety Division (AFSEC/SEW), will make the final determination regarding organizational independency requirements. The contractor shall include the ICBMSD in all communications between contractor and developer as required to maintain awareness of necessary developer interactions.",0
