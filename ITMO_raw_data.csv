The Navy Office of Information (CHINFO),"Mature, DoD-experienced IT Partner Our IT Division monitors developments that affect the Federal space and NOAA in particular, with special expertise in agile development methodology, cyber security, and cloud technology. We leverage Agile approaches and ties these constructs to tools such as our customer’s technology stack. We implement best practice, provided access to trending technology, and deliver on our promise of collaboration, flexibility, transparency, and a customer- focused partnership that ensures user engagement throughout the process. Expertise in Emerging Areas and Technologies RIVA strives to stay ahead of the latest innovations in IT management and software development (e.g., Agile, DevOps, Cyber, ITSM) and emerging areas such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), cloud migration, mobility, cybersecurity, and our partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as our Microsoft Azure partnership This expertise ensures our solutions are on the cutting edge of technology and best practices and that we can apply new FedRamp approved cloud offerings to solve real-world NOAA challenges.. Best Practices RIVA follows and is certified in industry best practices including CMMI, ITIL, and ISO 90001:2008, 20000, and 27001, and prioritizes certifications such as PMBOK/PMP and CISSP.

Note: The Government at its discretion may place the SDP on contract. Refer to Appendix I for suggested SDP content.

– In addition to aligning our processes to a standard Waterfall methodology, we propose to expand the use of Agile Scrum-based processes into our development methodology. Working with the Federal Web App Team lead, we will work to adopt iterative sprints that rapidly adapt to change rather than predicting unanticipated change, thereby focusing on customer satisfaction through quick and cyclic delivery of production-ready software components. Utilizing this methodology, software specifications are derived from established user stories, and as development sprints are completed, we perform code reviews, testing, and Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) to facilitate deployment into the production environment. Some of the benefits of an agile approach are:
 Production ready software that provides business value to system users as rapidly as possible.
 Clear requirements from meetings between government stakeholders and RIVA project staff
 Reprioritization of functional and non-functional requirements within each sprint cycle, reducing associated rework costs by aligning iterative releases with user stories and needs
 Adapt quickly to frequent or significant changes in projects while continuing to deliver
 Incorporation of emerging technologies into the solution.
Using an Agile-based development model, RIVA facilitates QC by considering relevant aspects of the development process, improving solution quality iteratively, documenting the system as it is developed, and being cognizant of compliance requirements such as existing TRMs, Service Level Architecture Guidelines, and security mandates. We perform work in two to four-week sprints. Each sprint begins with a Sprint Planning meeting to prioritize and assign product backlog items to the sprint backlog. We conduct daily Scrum Meetings or “stand ups” to discuss short term tasking and identify project obstacles to manage and escalate activities to the appropriate person. At the completion of each sprint, we conduct a Sprint Review meeting to demonstrate functionality that was developed and document stakeholder feedback for incorporation into the next sprint cycle. We hold Sprint Retrospective meetings to document lessons learned and adjust processes and procedures as needed.
Team RIVA understands that NCCOS has a centralized inventory and key attributes of applications, databases, and websites. As part of our support, we maintain and update this inventory to provide transparency into NCCOS systems and as requested and perform assessments of identified items within the inventory to provide guidance on future technological objectives. Some of these initiatives include feasibility assessments for migrating additional applications, data, and websites to cloud hosted solutions such as MS Azure; conducting security/risk assessments to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate negative outcomes; performing technology obsolescence/refresh studies to identify future strategies; and addressing skill set gaps and other operational risks. We work with NCCOS scientists, product owners, and end users to implement and manage the initiatives for GIS software and support the development and maintenance of applications based upon spatially referenced data and digital mapping.
For feasibility, technology, and migration assessments, we prepare proposals for recommended solutions to remediate any issues known or identified. For new project requests, we assist NCCOS staff in evaluating the request, the current team skill sets, capabilities, and availability, and existing partnerships to identify the appropriate solution to meet the request. These requests are captured and tracked in a centralized product backlog and are identified as new development, enhancement, or defect/change request and is maintained using the NCCOS BMC TrackIt ticketing system and Google Drive products. Once the course of action has been reviewed and approved, our team supports the necessary design and development of the solution and works with the product owner to ensure mission goals and objectives are met. This includes supporting and facilitating NCCOS staff for Branch or Partner led development efforts to improve enterprise system performance and availability. Prior to deployment into the production environment, we work with NCCOS to conduct integration and functional testing and any major issues are addressed before migration and that we receive approval from the CCB. For existing applications, databases, and websites, we perform corrective and adaptive maintenance to ensure compliance with technology goals, security requirements, and NOS policy and standards.
Throughout the development process, we follow NOS Configuration Management processes and industry best practices to maintain proper version control for all development, test, and production version of software and systems to allow for traceability and proper support and installation of deployment packages. We manage software code repositories to maintain all development, test and production versions of software, applications, and websites. Software versioning (unique version names or numbers assigned to each unique state of software) is implemented as part of this process and kept in an official Git repository provided by the Government. In addition, we use the SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) for secure remote login from one computer to another. This protocol will be used to access government-controlled Git repositories and Git deployment of all application code from Git repositories to Azure webapps. We maintain strict SSL access control to all SQL and MySQL databases. We maintain and update system documentation based on changes in a content management system.

For example developing a POA&M Guideline for NWS System Owners and support personnel containing the necessary information and instructions for developing, maintaining, and reporting their weaknesses in a database as it relates to a specific system. We understand that CSAM is the tool being used to track POA&M and our team has extensive experience working with CSAM at past and current clients, including NOAA and SBA.
Quality and completeness checks of security authorization packages
 Team SMRC adheres to a continuous improvement and monitoring based approach for security authorization packages. We take the approach that security authorization must be updated to be effective and as part of our overall security project management process, build in processes to ensure that security authorization packages are reviewed and updated regularly. This is most important with the upcoming release of NIST-800.53 R5. Our team regularly monitors changes in IT Security Governance and will update documents as changes are approved. Our collective experience doing Assessment & Authorization for multiple agencies has given us unique insights into the typical issues agency IT systems face while trying to get and maintain an ATO in addition to developing compliant documentation. Our certified CISSP experts will provide expertise, guidance and recommendations on Assessment & Authorization strategies for NWS systems. Our experts work with system owners to conduct compliance review, suggest & implement controls that provide optimal risk exposure to their systems.
Develop and deliver IT Security training As part of the Compliance review process, we will collaborate with existing training development processes to impart training and guidance to staff when required regarding best practices for IT security as well as requirements so that security is considered and implemented during the entire lifecycle. We will support development and revision of relevant courseware and conduct training and presentations so system staff is aware of IT security requirements.

From NOAA/NESDIS premises to the public cloud locations From public cloud locations to NOAA/NESDIS premise Team RIVA will use AWS Direct Connect, VPN CloudHub, Microsoft Azure VPN Express or similar services to connect from NOAA on premise to the public cloud. Bandwidth is metered between 50Mbps and 10 Gbps so aggregate bandwidth must be modeled for sandbox to determine the appropriate level.  Team RIVA would look to cap bandwidth based on 12 month estimate to avoid unnecessary expenditure.
Across any two locations within public cloud In this scenario, there are two general cost scenarios. Data transfer costs depend on whether data is being exchanged with-in an availability zone or across availability zones. Intra region (within an availability zone) data transfer costs are free and should not be charged any bandwidth surcharge. Inter-region data transfer does incur a per GB/Gbps cost and must be modeled. Inbound Data transfer costs in Azure and AWS are free.
From public cloud locations to general public endpoints
From public cloud locations to other cloud (public, private, or hybrid clouds) locations CSP per GB Data transfer costs must be modeled for any data transfer that originates from the public cloud to an endpoint that is a public, private or hybrid cloud
Data traversing a Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) stack Currently the TIC Overlay architecture is in Pilot mode for CSPs and has not been fully FedRAMP approved. Thus any use case requiring TIC data traverse should be reviewed by JAB/FedRAMP for applicability
From NOAA/NESDIS premises to the public cloud locations From public cloud locations to NOAA/NESDIS premise Inbound Data transfer costs in Azure and AWS are free, However, Team RIVA will need to model the effective cost on outbound transfer from the NOAA/NESDIS premises as that consumes ISP bandwidth even if it is a fixed cost. In this scenario, appropriate throttling needs to be put in place for high bandwidth applications.
Team RIVA is currently supporting AWS RDS and DynamoDB services for NESDIS Team RIVA will ensure that for the NESDIS Cloud BPA, FedRAMP compliant cloud-native Managed Database Services will be incorporated into sandbox templates for deployment. As part of the responsibility, Team RIVA will provide full DBMS administrative control to the administrator account. Team RIVA will support ""Managed Database Services"" which include standard database management tasks such as DBMS provisioning (including templated environments) as well as providing alternatives for DBMS security, operations, scaling, backups, patch management, and replication. Team RIVA has experience managing these functions via the CSP management console or CLI for advanced automation tasks.Team RIVA understands that no organization has an unlimited budget; therefore, it is necessary to monitor utilization and costs across internal and cloud based assets. Team RIVA will provide NOAA with CloudCheckr for tracking all billing. CloudCheckr offers a variety of cost based billing reports. The cost reports not only show NOAA how much it is paying for its AWS architecture, but also highlights areas where costs could be better optimized. Billing reports will show NOAA’s current AWS invoice, how much NOAA has spent on each service, and provide a billing history. The metrics provided by CloudCheckr are on a web accessible portal that contains historical data within a 365-day timespan, cost summaries, and details categorized across NOAA groups through the use of tagging. CloudCheckr’s data is made available every hour. CloudCheckr gives NOAA a consolidated, single pane of glass to better organize, manage, and optimize its cloud environment. Aggressive monitoring and fiscal control of distributed cloud resources will enable NESDIS to ensure that the organization is maximizing scientific experimentation within the bounds of the fiscal limitations. For the NESDIS Cloud environment, there will be a large focus on cost optimization related to the many algorithmic processing sandboxes that need to be managed in the AWS cloud environment to ensure performance and cost targets are met.
In addition, Team RIVA BPA Program Manager is constantly monitoring what CSP services are FedRAMP approved, under JAB Review or under 3PAO Assessment. For example, a partial listing of the AWS CSP matrix is listed in Figure 5. Team RIVA also tracks the appropriate matrices for other CSPs such as Microsoft Azure which is available in the Azure ServiceTrust Portal. Team RIVA understands the importance of ensuring the security requirements of any future service are appropriately considered before moving into the concept stage.
Team RIVA adopts cloud best practices for cloud migration to ensure a seamless process for managing or migrating critical workload. Team RIVA is currently executing similar migration work for NESDIS and will ensure that the following elements are addressed:
• Team RIVA will function as a migration services partner with NESDIS to successfully migrate applications to and from the cloud using CSP best practices
• Team RIVA will function as an application management services partner with NOAA to administer, maintain, and support applications in the cloud in accordance with FedRAMP and NOAA security guidelines.
The typical process is outline in Figure 6 below:




Figure 6:  Stages of TEAM RIVA’s Cloud Migration Process

In the cloud migration process to create new sandbox environments in a CSP it is paramount that the security posture of the environment is maintained before, during and after the migration. Therefore, the following best practices must be followed as part of the process to harden security:
• Safeguarding CSP credentials in accordance with FISMA/FedRAMP guidance
• Restrict users to AWS resources
• Automate security policies
• Adopting and testing a recovery strategy
In addition to effectively manage a cloud environment, new services need to be evaluated to ensure alignment and efficiency with the latest cloud technology. As the NESDIS Cloud Sandbox environment evolves, Team RIVA can match the evolution to new cloud services that may allow for cost or processing efficiencies.
The four stages of cloud transformation are described in Figure 7 and the Cloud Transformation Maturity Model. The steps include the Project Phase where the scope and design of the project are determined, then the Foundation Stage where the cloud environment requirements and services required are assessed. This phase can also include the necessary development processes that enable migration or making environments cloud ready. Then the project can enter the Migration phase where first dry runs can be executed to ensure the integrity of the data stays intact during migration and ultimately to a production
A.3 Overview of Technical Services applied to Specified Requirements
A.3.1 Virtual Machines (VM) (SOW 5.1)
Team RIVA will support cloud based virtual machines with the capabilities outlined in the BPA incuding RAM, vCPU, CPU bursting, VM Cloning/Templating , Geographic Location and ability to export OVFs (for migration, backup etc). In addition, Team RIVA will support Windows Server, RHEL and Open Source Linux. In addition , Team RIVA maintains an operational CSP checklist when deploying VMs to ensure adherence to security policy and best practices. These items include but are not limited to the following:
• Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide user-specific, rather than shared credentials for making AWS infrastructure requests.
• Ensure instances have Elastic Block Store versus instance store-backed which is not appropriate for enterprise grade storage
• Configure the appropriate Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) static address assignments, elastic IP addresses, or dynamic DNS).
• Leverage separate EBS volumes for the operating system and application/database data where appropriate.
• Configure back up for Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using Amazon EBS snapshots or another 3rd-party backup tool
• Test our process of recovering our EC2 instances or EBS volumes when they fail, either through”golden” Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Amazon EBS snapshots, bootstrapping, or using backup and recovery tools.
A.3.2 Cloud Sandbox Services (SOW 5.2)
Team RIVA will provide public cloud based sandbox services with the following capabilities:
• Capability of scaling sandboxes to meet project size/capability requirements
• Modular pricing model based on utilization of services within the sandbox
• Support compliance with FISMA regulations when utilizing IaaS (AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure)
• Ability to create and store blueprints/templates within the sandboxes
Team RIVA will ensure that the cloud environment is deployed in AWS using a proven architecture with highly available data tier, and web tier in the architecture. Team RIVA uses AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), Auto Scaling where necessary and Elastic Load Balancing at the infrastructure layer to provide application layer high availability. Each region in AWS is a separate geographic area.
Each region is comprised of multiple AZs, isolated physical and logical locations with low-latency connectivity. Team RIVA’s design utilizes best practices by featuring application layer redundancy, with layers independently elastic, with no single points of failure (SPOF) providing for highly available infrastructure for the NESDIS Cloud environment. Furthermore, each service component (web delivery, application services, and database) has services that are designed to be self-healing through proactive monitoring and automated failover if any individual components or entire virtual servers fail.
In terms of maintaining uptime, Team RIVA understands the criticality of the NESDIS Cloud environment and Team RIVA has the ability to both monitor it using AWS CloudWatch monitoring


services as well as traditional host based SNMP based monitoring using tools such as Nagios to monitor specific application ports and protocols if further monitoring is required. Team RIVA also leverages synthetic external monitoring to mimic end user access of the system to alert on any slow page load or system error if any externally facing sites are required. In addition, Team RIVA leverages automated snapshots of virtual machines to ensure that environments can be restored quickly within restoration targets in case of data or virtual machine (vm) corruption. Storage Services (SOW 5.3) Team RIVA will provide public cloud based storage services, including persistent and archival storage. Team RIVA will support creating EBS volumes and maintain snapshots for restoration. In addtion, we will ensure that we can provide up to 1PB in Network Attached storage or S3 Object storage and will architect the storage requirements based on performance requirements. Team RIVA will assign and configure Geographic storage affinity and configure RBAC based access as required.
A.3.3 Network Device Management and Configuration (SOW 5.4)

A.3.5 Management Capabilities and Tools (SOW 5.6)
Team RIVA provide the following public cloud based management capabilities and tools ensuring that Deployments and configurations shall be managed through an automation tool. Team RIVA currently uses a combination of Chef/Puppet Ansible in the existing NESDIS environment we are managing.
RIVA will also monitor VM, Network, and Storage Services and manage associated alerts/reporting using Cloudwatch or similar tools. Team RIVA will monitor key system metrics on a monthly basis including CPU, memory, swap space, io wait time, application response time and availability. Based on these metrics Team RIVA will propose system changes to enhance efficiency. Team RIVA will ensure that AWS workloads are following AWS best practices for component reuse. For reusability, Team RIVA will ensure that the deployment process includes as much automation as feasible to reduce cycle times and will leverage approached like using a “gold image” baseline for operating systems.
A.4 Data Management Procedures
Team RIVA will advise the NESDIS Project Team with regards to best practices for the architecture of the NESDIS Cloud system and how enhancements to the system and upgrades to the infrastructure will fit into the overall architecture. We will support the development of a reference architecture and coding standards that ensure Team RIVA and NESDIS IT staff have a shared understanding of the NESDIS Cloud Sandbox environment and applications. We will assist with the development and implementation of policies and procedures for change management, configuration management and software development standards and will provide software tools that support consistent understanding and use of these procedures. All cloud tasks will be in accordance with NOAA security policy.
A.5 Understanding of Concept
Team RIVA will manage the environment based on the requirements and approach outlined in Section

Team RIVA will develop the following documents using the NOAA OIT recommended templates of security artifacts. The following deliverables will be submitted at least annually or upon significant change to the system, and the details contained in the documents will reflect the actual environment as built:
• Security Categorization Form (SCF) to be completed with support from the Business Owner/ISSO
• Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Form, which is signed off by the NOAA Director of Privacy
• E-Authentication Form
• System Security Plan (SSP)
• Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP), to include the relevant parts specific to the system being developed/maintained.
• ISCP Annual Exercise/Test
Team RIVA will work with the Security Risk and Compliance teams to make sure the environment exceeds the necessary requirement and FISMA moderate standards. As the environment expands and scales, Team RIVA will ensure that the same secure configuration baseline that is derived from a “gold” image that is a known good. For IT System level, we engage the security accreditation team early and often to build security in at the beginning of every effort (when system waivers are not applicable). We recognize the lead times necessary for ATO and we make sure that no external team will ever wait on us to deliver artifacts. During system categorization, we build the necessary documentation to fully define Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) levels of High, Moderate, or Low, and then work with


the external teams to define controls across the system. During system development we continuously assess, test, and scan those controls to ensure compliance at the appropriate categorization.

NUCLEAR SAFETY CROSS CHECK ANALYSIS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND TECHNICAL EVALUATION INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION  (NSCCA / PATE / IV&V),"The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems Directorate has a continuing requirement for nuclear safety cross check analysis, performance analysis and technical evaluation, independent verification and validation contract.

BACKGROUND
The Minuteman III (MMIII) is a mature weapon system that is in the Operations and Support Phase of its life cycle. As a critical leg in the strategic nuclear triad, the ICBM Weapon System requires continued sustainment of the critical software to ensure operational capabilities are maintained and new war-fighter requirements are implemented and independently certified for operational nuclear surety. The ICBM weapon system software requires updates and independent nuclear certification to provide a supportable and functional weapon system through 2075. The NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor independently assesses that nuclear critical software will only perform as intended: There has been no intentional/unintentional sabotage, and will not cause any unintended nuclear consequences.

Based on historical data, the anticipated workload is expected to be approximately 85% NSCCA/PATE and 15% IV&V.

REQUIREMENTS
Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis/Performance Analysis and Technical Evaluation/Independent Verification and Validation

Nuclear critical software evaluations are accomplished through NSCCA and IV&V code review, simulation testing, and deep analysis. Although these evaluations use many similar techniques, they typically have different requirements and, consequently, the analysis and reporting are different. Since NSCCA affects software that is nuclear critical, the contractor needs to consider that a significant majority of the effort under this PWS will be slanted toward NSCCA efforts and that IV&V efforts are subsidiary to NSCCA. IV&V efforts typically involve programs that support nuclear critical software. The analysis under IV&V ensures compliance with requirements levied on the software being studied. PATE efforts, currently not mandated by the Safety Center, are considered in parallel with other analysis. Both NSCCA and IV&V are performed by an organization that is technically, managerially, and financially independent of the developer. The AFSEC/SEW will make the final determination regarding independence requirements.

Nuclear safety design certified software is evaluated according to the Government Certification Requirements Plan (CRP). AFMAN 91-119, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems Software, provides criteria for NSCCA evaluation. Requirements for software evaluation can range from full NSCCA to IV&V/NSATE to qualification testing, depending on the relationship to critical functions such as authorization, pre-arming, launching, releasing, arming, and targeting. Requirements for software evaluation can change according to the current Air Force directives. ALL current Air Force nuclear certification requirements must be integrated and followed and are to be followed by the NSCCA contractor as soon as declared in force unless exempted by waiver.

NSCCA and IV&V evaluations will parallel the development lifecycle with incremental deliveries of requirements, design, and code changes from the program and developers as defined at task order level.

Nuclear Surety

The Air Force uses the DoD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program definition for Nuclear Weapons Surety: Policies, procedures, controls, and actions that encompass safety, security, and control measures which ensure there will be no nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, or degradation of weapon effectiveness during its lifecycle. The contractor shall comply with requirements listed in Appendix B: Applicable Compliance/Reference Documents.

The contractor shall support the Government in maintaining its ICBM Nuclear Certification Program IAW requirements detailed in DoD Directive (DoDD) 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapon Surety Program, DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program Manual, and AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.

Engineering Services

The contractor shall perform tasks in accordance with separately issued task orders providing engineering, technical, and support services, as specified therein.

Tools Sustainment

The contractor shall maintain and modify Government Furnished Property (GFP) (see Section 5: Property Management) that is provided in support of ICBM NSCCA/PATE IV&V task orders. The objectives of NSCCA/PATE/IV&V tools include accelerating analyses, reducing Government Test Lab needs by the NSCCA/PATE/IV&V contractor, and the ability to confirm anomalies that are difficult to or cannot be replicated in the Government labs.

Program Support

The contractor shall maintain technical, managerial, and financial independence from ICBM Program software developers IAW AFI 91-103. The Air Force Safety Center, Weapons Safety Division (AFSEC/SEW), will make the final determination regarding organizational independency requirements. The contractor shall include the ICBMSD in all communications between contractor and developer as required to maintain awareness of necessary developer interactions.",0

coordination between HSG staff and the RFCs and other support providers within the NWS enterprise is required, using verbal and
written forms of communication, in order to effectively provide the customer support.
The contractor provides technical support to ensure the operational performance and integrity of CHPS. This support includes the
following objectives:
1) Provide specialized â€œhelp-deskâ€ technical support whereby operational problems, issues, and questions are presented to the
contractor for resolution. Support will be provided in the form of problem tracking, problem analysis, and ultimately
problem resolution for CHPS issues (a.k.a. â€œticketsâ€ or â€œcasesâ€) reported by the RFCs. This support can be provided by
action taken on an RFC computer system, direct communication to RFC staff, or advice and instructions which address the
reported problem. Communication may include direct phone conversations, e-mail, or software documentation. The â€œhelpdeskâ€
problem resolution typically involves relatively specific issues reported with CHPS which often require prompt
attention.
2) Provide technical support for NWS projects associated with CHPS. This can include projects related to the CHPS software
system environment, the CHPS hardware configuration, or the hydrometeorologic functions embodied within CHPS. The
project support typically involves more general needs of the CHPS operations, and generally do not require immediate
attention. These project outcomes result in more stable, more efficient operation of CHPS at RFCs.
3) Provide technical guidance (written and verbal), training, and coordination of operational functions in a pro-active manner,
including monitoring and preventative maintenance of systems executing the CHPS software suite. Collectively, these
activities result in a support enterprise that promotes a high level of competence for operational readiness, competence, and
awareness among RFC users of CHPS.
These objectives comprise part of and are consistent with the formal operating plan goal of the NWS to â€œProvide 24 x 7 support to
address operational issues related to AWIPS and CHPS hydrologic software at 13 RFCs and 122 WFOsâ€. The end result of the
completed objectives is the stable and functional operation of the NWS RFC river forecasting services provided by CHPS. This
operation allows formal NWS products to be issued and NWS services to be provided to the other NWS offices, the public, and the nationâ€™s water resource enterprise. Note that this task does not involve direct support for NWS WFOs (Weather Forecast Office),
which execute AWIPS, but do execute CHPS.",1
