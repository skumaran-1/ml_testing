to001 chps,"1.02 Objectives: The overall objective of this task is to obtain contractor support to supplement the specialized CHPS support “help
desk” functions performed by the Hydrology Support Group (HSG) in the Office of Central Processing (OCP) Field Support and
Infrastructure Team (FSIT). The HSG provides Tier 1 and Tier 2 support for the CHPS operations at RFCs. The contract staff works
alongside the federal HSG members, and the specific task requirements are provided by the HSG staff. Historically, the full CHPS
support has been handled by a team consisting of 2-3 federal employees supplemented by (2) contract employees. Significant
coordination between HSG staff and the RFCs and other support providers within the NWS enterprise is required, using verbal and
written forms of communication, in order to effectively provide the customer support.
The contractor provides technical support to ensure the operational performance and integrity of CHPS. This support includes the
following objectives:
1) Provide specialized “help-desk” technical support whereby operational problems, issues, and questions are presented to the
contractor for resolution. Support will be provided in the form of problem tracking, problem analysis, and ultimately
problem resolution for CHPS issues (a.k.a. “tickets” or “cases”) reported by the RFCs. This support can be provided by
action taken on an RFC computer system, direct communication to RFC staff, or advice and instructions which address the
reported problem. Communication may include direct phone conversations, e-mail, or software documentation. The “helpdesk”
problem resolution typically involves relatively specific issues reported with CHPS which often require prompt
attention.
2) Provide technical support for NWS projects associated with CHPS. This can include projects related to the CHPS software
system environment, the CHPS hardware configuration, or the hydrometeorologic functions embodied within CHPS. The
project support typically involves more general needs of the CHPS operations, and generally do not require immediate
attention. These project outcomes result in more stable, more efficient operation of CHPS at RFCs.
3) Provide technical guidance (written and verbal), training, and coordination of operational functions in a pro-active manner,
including monitoring and preventative maintenance of systems executing the CHPS software suite. Collectively, these
activities result in a support enterprise that promotes a high level of competence for operational readiness, competence, and
awareness among RFC users of CHPS.
These objectives comprise part of and are consistent with the formal operating plan goal of the NWS to “Provide 24 x 7 support to
address operational issues related to AWIPS and CHPS hydrologic software at 13 RFCs and 122 WFOs”. The end result of the
completed objectives is the stable and functional operation of the NWS RFC river forecasting services provided by CHPS. This
operation allows formal NWS products to be issued and NWS services to be provided to the other NWS offices, the public, and the nation’s water resource enterprise. Note that this task does not involve direct support for NWS WFOs (Weather Forecast Office),
which execute AWIPS, but do execute CHPS."

to005 oar aoml,"1.3 Objectives
Since all three FMCs (OAR/AOML, OAR/STAR, NESDIS/STAR) have common control and compliance requirements, the goal of this project will be to modify the development and production infrastructure currently in operation at OAR/AOML to accept and process internal management control actions from multiple FMCs (AOML/PMEL/NESDIS).
The development infrastructure at OAR/AOML will need to implement additional infrastructure in order to scale up development efforts to meet the overall development requirements. The code base will also need to be reviewed to identify new requirements as well as any necessary code refactoring. One of the modules in the system will need to function on mobile devices such as Apple IPAD with the ability to work offline.
